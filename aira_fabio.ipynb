Essentially, the main rea-son lies on the multidimensional problems of quality of life. Then, a research question \\nyet unaddressed rises: Is it possible to find very poor people who feel happy? If so, what \\ncontrols this relationship? The first main contribution of this study is the application of \\nmodern measurement theory to measure happiness. The short Oxford Happiness Question-\\nnaire jointly with an ad hoc Multidimensional Poverty Index-MPI (8 items) were applied to a random sample of 537 household heads who live in the five poorest districts in Peru. \\nItem response theory analysis was conducted to measure happiness scores. Findings reveal \\nhappiness scores and the MPI are negatively associated in the very poor Peru. Friendship, religiosity, and some relevant non-material characteristics of a family are the most impor -\\ntant covariates of the relationship between these variables. In fact, the second contribution \\nof this study represents the inclusion of variables associated to the quantity and quality of \\nfriendship as relevant controllers of happiness and poverty.\\nKeywords Peru\\xa0· Happiness\\xa0· Extreme poverty\\xa0· Item response theory\\n1 Introduction\\nResearch on the relationship between happiness and poverty among the very poor peo-\\nple has almost remained untouchable since Graham and Pettinato (2002) identified the \\nparadox of unhappy growth in Peru and Russia: while poor people are happy, those with \\ndistinctive income gains are frustrated. Later, Lora et\\xa0al. (2010) found consistent results in Latin America. In contrast, the relationship between inequality and happiness has been \\nwidely studied in the United States (Alesina et\\xa0al. 2004; Oishi et\\xa0al. 2011), in Germany \\n(Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005), and in Latin America (Graham and Felton 2005). Across all this \\namount of research the constructs of happiness and poverty emerge, and some questions, \\n * Pedro Mateu \\n pf.mateub@up.edu.pe\\n1 Department of\\xa0Economics, Universidad del Pacífico, Jr. Sánchez Cerro 2050, Jesús\\xa0María, \\nLima\\xa011, Peru\\n1076 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nspecifically about happiness, are raised: how it is defined, how it is measured, how reliable \\neach measure is.\\nIndependently of previous questions, there are other interesting questions this paper \\naims to study: What is the distribution of happiness scores among the very poor people in Peru? Is there a meaningful relationship between happiness and poverty among the very \\npoor? What traits or characteristics of the very poor Peru, if any, control this relationship? \\nIs it possible to think that people who lived with deprivation, they could be happy in any \\nway? How relevant is the quality and quantity of friends for happy very poor people? To \\naddress all these research questions, household heads from the five poorest districts of Peru were surveyed in 2017 through an instrument that included the Oxford Happiness Inven-\\ntory, 29 items which show different manifestations of happiness.\\nThe existence of this kind of instrument, developed by psychologists Michael Argyle, \\nMaryanne Martin, and Jill Crossland (as cited in Hills and Argyle 2002, p. 1073) in 1989, allows the authors to improve the measurement of happiness. Given, the hypothesized \\nnature of this construct is continuous, item response theory was utilized to measure loca-\\ntions of individuals along the happiness. Conversely, poverty is a theoretical construct \\nwidely measured through different operationalizations. Multidimensional poverty index is the selected measure of poverty for this study; see Alkire and James (2011) for a complete \\ndiscussion of this measure.\\n2  On happiness and\\xa0measurement\\nThere has been an enormous discussion on what happiness is from the classical time. Even \\nif Aristotle set up a canonical definition happiness or eudaimonia, today the discussion \\ncontinues and the schools focus on particular aspects of that (Aristotle n.d./2009). Four \\ndefinitions may be stressed. From a perspective of several psychologists, happiness entails a state of satisfaction due to the situation of oneself in life which means to be able to pur -\\nsuit purpose or meaning in life with no restrictions (Alidina 2015; Csikszentmihalyi 2008; Graham 2017; Hone et\\xa0al. 2014; Steger 2012). First, happiness can be understood as a state \\nof continuum satisfaction which is fulfilled when controlling inner experiences (Csikszent-mihalyi 2008). Secondly, Alidina (2015) posited happiness as a level of mindfulness. It can \\nbe conceived as a state of alertness a person is to discard any negative feelings in the search \\nfor attaining happiness. Thirdly, Hone et\\xa0al. (2014) reported happiness as a high level of \\nsubjective well-being after a process of flourishing, not only as individuals but also as a community. Finally, happiness is represented as a direct effect of having sought purpose \\nof life and encompasses a person as a whole (Rappaport and Fossler 1993; Reker et\\xa0al. \\n1987; Robak and Griffin 2000; Steger 2012). Based on these four definitions, three terms \\nare used interchangeably: “happiness”, “subjective well-being”, and “life satisfaction” for \\nmany social scientists.\\nAlong the same lines, happiness is an outcome of having attained a set of targets. From \\nan individual standing, a person must prepare, cultivate and control their inner experience first to achieve happiness (Chen 2007; Koufaris 2002; Shernoff et\\xa0al. 2003). This learn-\\ning process implies the suppression of negative feelings (Academic Mindfulness Interests Group 2006; Langer 1989; Schonert-Reichl and Stewart 2010). Under a macro perspec-\\ntive, happiness is also the main goal of implementing public strategies that help citizens \\nachieve a high level of subjective well-being (Fredrickson and Losada 2005; Keynes 2002, \\n2016). Certainly, happiness does not represent a guaranteed outcome. In fact, these public \\n1077\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\nstrategies shall be considered as opportunities to seek fulfilling lives (Graham 2017). Thus, \\nthis paper suits the whole purpose of research when identifying needs or opportunities that \\nmay derive in public strategies with potential effects and ideal delivery.\\nFrom the umbrella of measurement, happiness metrics can be divided in hedonic met-\\nrics which capture the manifestations of happiness at a specific moment as daily lives occur; and evaluative metrics (eudaimonic metrics) which capture respondents’ manifesta-\\ntions of their lives as a whole (Delle Fave et\\xa0al. 2011; Graham and Nikolova 2013; Gra-\\nham 2017; National Research Council 2013). Most studies of happiness measure it with \\none single question “How satisfied are you with your life?” and “How happy are you with \\nyour life” for evaluative purposes (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Frey and Stutzer 1995; \\nHelliwell et\\xa0al. 2018), or “Did you experience happiness yesterday?” and “Did you smiled \\nyesterday?” for hedonic purpose (Graham and Pettinato 2002). In this paper, happiness is a latent variable.\\nAll psychological measurements are unreliable in some degree (Croker and Algina \\n2008). They asserted when a test is administered, the only way of assuring results can be \\nreplicated if the same individuals were tested again under similar circumstances is through \\nproviding reliability estimates of the test (Croker and Algina 2008). Then, before any meas-urement instrument is used for research, its reliability must be established. To show jointly, \\na degree of correlation and agreement between measurements, intraclass correlation coeffi-\\ncient (ICC) is a desirable measure of reliability (Koo and Li 2016). Under the classical test \\ntheory Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is one of the most used procedures for estimating reli-\\nability (internal consistency) and it is considered as the lower-bound estimate of reliability. \\nResearchers who use happiness measures do not report either Cronbach’s alpha or any ICC due to the dependability on a single question (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Frey and \\nStutzer 1995; Graham and Pettinato 2002; Helliwell et\\xa0al. 2018).\\n3  Study objectives and\\xa0questions investigated\\nGiven the importance of Peruvian very poor population living the five poorest districts of \\nPeru as a primary source of information for measuring happiness, the primary objective of \\nthe study was to improve the measurement of happiness and providing more evidence of \\nthe relationship between happiness and poverty. The focal questions investigated were:\\n1. What is the distribution of happiness scores among the very poor household heads?\\n2. Is there a meaningful relationship between happiness and poverty among the very poor \\nhousehold heads?\\na. What traits or characteristics of very poor household heads, if any, control this \\nrelationship?\\nb. What are the main characteristics of these very poor household heads who are happy \\nand why?\\n3. Can the results from the second research question consistent when using one single \\nquestion to measure happiness?\\nExpressed in the form of a null and alternative hypotheses related to find a relationship \\nbetween happiness and poverty among the very poor, they were:\\n1078 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nwhere /u1D70C represents a correlation coefficient, X represents the happiness scale and Y rep-\\nresents the multidimensional poverty index. The specificities associated with each scale \\nmeasurement are described in the “Method” part.\\n4  Method\\n4.1  Design\\nTo investigate whether there is a relationship between happiness and poverty controlled by \\nother factors, a nonexperimental design was utilized.\\n4.2  Sample\\nTo begin with, sampling units and unit of analysis are not the same in this study. The sam-pling unit of this study is the dwelling where a household lives in. The unit of analysis is \\neach household head (participant). The National Institute of Statistics -INEI in Spanish- \\ndeveloped a monetary poverty ranking of 1943 districts (INEI 2015).\\n1 Based on census \\ninformation of 2007, the dwellings database provided by INEI had a total of N=6889  \\nunique records for the five poorest districts of Peru.2 It represented the usable sampling \\nframe. A multistage random sampling design was conducted. In the last stage, the number \\nof dwellings were allocated in four strata according to gender and literacy of the house-\\nhold head. Each stratum is composed of one interaction of these two factors: literate male, literate female, illiterate male, and illiterate female. Sample size determination yielded a \\nrandom sample of n = 537 that was drawn from the sampling frame using a proportional \\nallocation accordingly.\\n4.3  Instrumentation\\nThe “Happiness, Poverty, and Values of Two Perus” survey contains 230 items divided in \\n12 sections (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, education, happiness, social network, \\npersonal values, and religiosity, among others). Despite the length of the questionnaire, it \\nwas designed to elicit only pertinent information to the study.H0∶/u1D70CXY=0\\nH1∶/u1D70CXY≠0\\n1 This study belongs to a large project named “The determinants of happiness in two Perus: 2017\" funded \\nby the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at Universidad del Pacifico (Lima, Peru). Its main aim \\nwas to compare the level of happiness between the very poor and the very rich population of Peru (two strata). This study only focused on the five poorest districts, the very poor stratum. All derived inferences only pertain to this group.\\n2 Technically, due to many dwellings in the rural area of Peru are abandoned, the number of dwellings is in \\nfact, the number of households. In this way, overestimation of sample size is avoided.\\n1079\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\n4.3.1  Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ)\\nThe OHQ consisted of 29 items with a different modified scale, four-point frequency \\nscale instead of a six-point Likert scale (see the complete instrument in the “ Appendix”) \\nHills and Argyle (2002) acknowledged the construct of happiness measured by OHQ is considered as unidimensional. During the nineties, it has been widely used in Australia, Canada, Spain, UK, and USA. However, Yamamoto et\\xa0al. (2008) stressed that happiness \\nis strongly influenced by culture, specifically values. Failing to address that implies the \\nomission of the role of each culture in any happiness conception. From that perspective, \\nthe OHQ also represents a composite instrument of measurement because it consists of \\nitems related to different definitions of happiness: hedonic, evaluative, optimistic, and com-munity involvement.\\nWhile conducting the pilot survey, it was noticed that there were two types of head of \\nhousehold based on their skills to answer abstract questions. Only 2 out of 10 interviewees were able to answer the 29-items instrument. To anticipate item non-response issues, the \\nshorter version of OHQ (eight items) was an option to answer questions regarding happi-\\nness. Thus, 81% of the final sample used the short instrument.\\nThe lower-bound estimate of reliability over these eight ordinal-level items was deter -\\nmined using ordinal \\n/u1D6FC (see Gugiu et\\xa0al. 2010), assuming a unidimensional measurement \\nmodel and accounting for the ordinal level scaling of the items. For the obtained sample \\n/u1D6FC=0.81.\\n4.3.2  Cantril ladder question (WHR)\\nSince 2015, the World Happiness Report shows how people from different countries evalu-ate the quality of their current lives on a scale of 0–10. Additional details of this question is \\npresented in Helliwell et\\xa0al. (2018). While conducting the pilot survey, it was noticed that \\na scale of 0–20 was reasonable for data collection due to the grading scale of the Peruvian educational system.\\n4.3.3  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\\nIt originally relies on 10 indicators embedded in three dimensions: health, education, and living standards (Alkire and James 2011). For this study, there were some ad hoc adjust-\\nments in the index calculation.\\nIn the first dimension, only the nutrition indicator was considered. It was estimated \\nthrough body mass index (BMI) as a proxy of caloric ingest due to timing reasons when administering the entire questionnaire. Regarding the second dimension, the dynamic \\nnature of the school attendance indicator was modified to a static indicator due to data \\navailability and renamed as childhood education (stock). No further adjustment occurred \\nwith the asset’s indicator in the third dimension.\\n3\\n3 The eight indicators used to measure the multidimensional poverty index were calculated as follows:\\n (1) BMI: Three thresholds provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) depending on age groups were used. (2) Years of education: Privation \\nexists if a household member aged 12\\xa0years old or older, has reached the level of incomplete primary edu-cation. If all household members are deprived, then household is deprived. (3) Childhood education: Any child aged 11\\xa0 years old or younger is deprived if his current educational attainment does not fulfill the expected level of education according to his schooling age. (4) Electricity: Privation exists if the household has no electricity. (5) Drinking Water: Privation exists if the household does not have access to drinking \\n1080 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\n4.4  Analysis\\nClosed-response data were imported to R 3.5.0 for processing and analysis (R Foundation \\nfor Statistical Computing 2018). For happiness measurement, polychoric correlations were \\ncalculated due to the polytomous nature of the eight items of short OHQ. Ordinal alpha \\nwas calculated through psych package. Then, IRT application through a graded response model (GRM) with logit link function produced an accurate estimate of each person’s loca-\\ntion on the latent construct continuum. Certainly, the discrimination and extremity param-\\neters were also estimated. The GRM postulates that the conditional probability of the ith \\nsubject to endorse the kth response for the jth item is expressed as:\\nxij is the ordinal manifest variable with Ki possible response categories, zi is the standing \\nof the ith subject in the latent continuum variable, /u1D6FCj denotes the discrimination parameter, \\nand /u1D6FDjk ’s are the extremity parameters. /u1D702ijk is the linear latent predictor related to the trait. \\nFinally, /u1D6F9() is the cumulative density function of the standard logistic distribution. Estima-\\ntion of model parameters required the application of marginal maximum likelihood estima-tion (MMLE) using Ltm package. A detailed overview of this technique is presented in \\nBaker and Seack-Ho (2004), Rizopoulos (2006), and Tarazona et\\xa0al. (2013).\\nWhen regression analysis was conducted, coefficients’ estimates and estimated standard \\nerrors are displayed where relevant. There is one single significance level, 5%. SAS 9.4 was performed for descriptive and inferential statistics.xij/uni007C.varzi∼Categorical/parenleft.s1Pij1,…,Pijk/parenright.s1\\nP�xij=k�zi�=⎧\\n⎪\\n⎨\\n⎪⎩𝛹�𝜂ijk�, if k =1\\n𝛹�𝜂ijk�−𝛹�𝜂ij(k−1)�, if 1<k<Ki\\n1−𝛹�𝜂ij(k−1)�, if k =Ki\\n/u1D702ijk=/u1D6FCj/parenleft.s1zi−/u1D6FDjk/parenright.s1,\\n−∞= 𝛽j0<𝛽j1<⋯<𝛽jKi−1<𝛽jKi=∞\\ni=1,…,m;j=1,…,J;k=1,…,Ki\\nFootnote 3 (continued)\\nwater or the source is located more than 30\\xa0min on feet. (6) Sanitation: Privation exists if the household’s \\nsanitation facility is not improved, in other words, there are not protected pit latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. (7) Floor: Privation exists if the household has a dirt, sand, or dung floor. (8) Cooking fuel: Privation exists if the household cooks with dung, wood, or charcoal very frequently. The last eight indicators report a missing value if the head of household did not respond to the related questions. After calculating all these indicators and their specific relative weights (they slightly changed in contrast to the original version), a person is identified as multidimensionally poor if he/she is deprived in at least one third of the weighted MPI indicators. In other words, his/her reported index is equal to or higher than 1/3.\\n1081\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\n5  Results\\n5.1  Sociodemographic characteristics of\\xa0the\\xa0very poor heads of\\xa0household\\nBefore addressing the research questions, two findings can be stressed when analyzing \\nthe main characteristics of multidimensional poverty of the heads of households who live \\nin the five poorest districts of Peru. See Table\\xa0 1 for detailed traits. First, one out of five \\nhousehold heads report a BMI lower than 18.5 (CDC’s threshold for individuals older than \\n19). Second, one out of five household heads report incomplete primary education as the \\nhighest level of education attained. Third, four out of five household heads have access to \\nelectric service as well as drinking water either with water connection inside or outside the \\nhouse. Despite these findings, almost 100% of interviewees totally lack access to proper \\nsanitation and almost every household head use wood as the main cooking fuel. Then, there are some health issues to consider when analyzing the poorest Peruvian population.\\n5.2  The distribution of\\xa0happiness scores\\nThe short OHQ consisted of 8 polytomous items on a four-point frequency scale: ‘never’ (1), ‘sometimes’ (2), ‘most of the time’ (3), and ‘always’ (4). Originally reversed-worded \\nitems were changed due to respondent inattention and confusion in two different pilot sur -\\nveys (Van Sonderen et\\xa0al. 2013). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 1, the response pattern in each question \\ndisplays a large concentration around the middle categories, “sometimes” and “most of the time”. Four findings can be underlined. First, 48% of the very poor household heads feel \\n“most of the time” they are satisfied about everything in their life. Second, 47% of the very \\npoor household heads “always” have particularly happy memories of the past. Third, 25% \\nof the very poor household heads feel “sometimes” they can fit in everything they want to. \\nFinally, less than 7% “never” had particularly happy memories of the past, looked attrac-\\ntive, or felt that life is rewarding.Table 1  Components of the \\nMultidimensional Poverty IndexTrait/characteristic Total \\n(n = 537) (%)Male (n = 252) (%)Female (n = 285) (%)\\nMultidimensionally poor 47.57 50.00 45.42\\nHealth\\n\\xa0Body Mass Index 19.29 20.80 17.96\\nEducation\\n\\xa0Years of education 20.86 22.22 19.65\\n\\xa0Childhood education 14.53 15.48 13.68\\nLiving standard\\n\\xa0Electricity 19.18 20.63 17.89\\n\\xa0Drinking water 19.37 19.83 18.95\\n\\xa0Sanitation 96.65 96.03 97.19\\n\\xa0Floor 97.21 96.83 97.54\\n\\xa0Cooking fuel 97.21 96.03 98.25\\n1082 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nWhen fitting the model, an unconstrained GRM provides a better fit than the con-\\nstrained model (LRT  = 27.23, df = 7, p < 0.001). Regarding the estimated parameters, on \\none hand, Zickar et\\xa0al. (2002) point out that when 𝛼j>1 the item j  provides an accept-\\nable discrimination between individuals. Hafsteinsson et\\xa0 al. (2007) consider a highly \\ndiscriminant item when 𝛼j>2 . On the other hand, Thiessen (1986) recommends elim-\\ninating items which have a very low power of discrimination /parenleft.s1𝛼j<0.5/parenright.s1\\n . Considering \\nthese criteria, it was found all items have an acceptable level of discrimination between individuals along the continuum of happiness. Moreover, estimations extremity param-\\neters are acceptable (see Table\\xa02 ).\\nWhen analyzing the Item Response Category Characteristic Curves (ICC), there is \\na high probability of endorsing the first option, “never”, or conversely, there is a low probability of endorsing the fourth option, “always”, for relatively low latent trait lev -\\nels. These findings indicate that the items might be providing more information at low levels of happiness. Similar evidence can be derived from observing the Test Informa-\\ntion Curve (these graphical evidences are not shown but are available upon request). \\nThe set of eight items provides 62% of the total information for low latent trait levels. In fact, items “mentally alert” and “happy memories of the past” provide little infor -\\nmation in the whole latent trait continuum. These two items provide only 18.6% (i.e., \\nFig. 1  Proportions for each level of response for the short OHQ 8 items\\nTable 2  Item analysis of the short version of OHQ\\nR.drop = correlation item-total score dropping the item, Alpha = Cronbach alpha if an item is dropped, \\n̂𝛽k = estimated extremity parameter, ̂𝛼 = estimated discrimination parameterItem Classic indexes GRM indexes\\nMean SD R.drop Alpha ̂𝛽1̂𝛽2̂𝛽3̂𝛼\\nP600_1 3.2 0.77 0.56 0.79 − 2.936 − 1.362 0.444 1.878\\nP600_3 3.0 0.87 0.56 0.79 − 2.358 − 0.819 0.638 1.767\\nP600_12 3.2 0.77 0.58 0.79 − 3.080 − 1.220 0.532 1.943\\nP600_13 2.9 0.84 0.56 0.79 − 2.371 − 0.946 0.974 1.618\\nP600_16 3.2 0.83 0.52 0.79 − 3.406 − 1.570 0.379 1.470\\nP600_18 3.1 0.85 0.49 0.80 − 3.585 − 1.062 0.727 1.271\\nP600_21 3.1 0.90 0.49 0.80 − 3.207 − 1.202 0.518 1.228\\nP600_29 3.2 1.02 0.50 0.80 − 2.677 − 1.244 0.078 1.267\\n1083\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\n100×5.44∕29.32  ) of the total information. If a similar future study were conducted, \\nthese two items could probably be excluded.\\nFinally, the happiness scores using Empirical Bayes as the scoring method were esti-\\nmated based on the observed response patterns (see Fig.\\xa0 2). Different tests for normality, \\nfail to reject the null hypothesis ( p>0.15 ). Using standardized scores, the average happi-\\nness level is −0.3282 ±0.0367  . This indicates that the very poor heads of household are \\nmostly located in the low happiness continuum levels (66% of the sample).\\n5.3  Relationship between\\xa0happiness and\\xa0poverty among\\xa0the\\xa0very poor\\nThere is a negative association between the happiness scores and the multidimensional \\npoverty index for very poor household heads. This indicates that the higher the poverty \\nindex is reported, the lower the level of subjective well-being. Although the null hypoth-\\nesis of no correlation was rejected ( p<0.0001  ), the strength of the relationship is weak \\n( r=0.1831 ).\\n5.3.1  Controllers of\\xa0happiness\\nTo further examine the effect of potential controllers of happiness (not considered causal), \\na multiple regression analysis was performed to determine if happiness score was related \\nto the multidimensional poverty index (MPI*) and three sets of covariates: household char -\\nacteristics; education, health, and work; and social network and a spiritual link. In the first \\ngroup of covariates, there are household head’s age (age), household head is female (fem), \\nFig. 2  The distribution of the happiness standardized scores for the short OHQ 8 items under the uncon-\\nstrained GRM]\\n1084 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nhousehold head is cohabiting (cohab), household head is married (married), household \\nsize (hhs), one child at home (ch1), two children at home (ch2), one adult older than 60 at \\nhome (old1), and two adults older than 60 at home (old2). The second group of covariates \\nincludes household head has elementary school education or higher (ese), household head is obese (obese), household head is self-employed or employee (see), working hours in pri-\\nmary job (whpj), and primary job satisfaction (pjs). The third group of covariates include \\nsocial network size with 1–10 friends (fri10) and with more than 10 friends (fri11), social \\nnetwork strength on a weekly basis (netwee), social net strength in a daily basis (netday), \\nreliable friends as an interaction of social network size with 10 friends or less and social network strength on a weekly basis (int1), perception of getting help (pgh); and God impor -\\ntance (god). See Table\\xa0 3 for summary statistics. Examination of the residuals revealed that \\nthey are normally distributed ( \\np>0.15 ). Results indicated that the overall model appears \\nto be a good fit, F(22, 439 )=5.03, p<0.0001  and accounts for a moderate percentage of \\nhappiness scores variability, R2=0.2015 .\\nAs shown in Table\\xa0 4 (column 4), the multidimensional poverty index for heads of \\nhousehold contributed to the overall prediction of happiness.

Regarding the first group of covari-\\nates, several and relevant non-causal effects were detected. Both age and sex of house-\\nhold heads, increase and decrease happiness ( p=0.005  and p=0.204  , respectively). In \\nfact, a female household heads reflect a lower subjective well-being in comparison to males. Marital status, either cohabitation or marriage, contribute positively to increase \\nhappiness and so does when a family’s first child ( \\np=0.031  ). The last two findings \\nare somehow opposite to Glass et\\xa0al. (2016)’s study for industrialized societies. They \\nclaimed lower levels of happiness among parents than nonparents. Along these lines, \\nwith a marginally significant effect, living with an elder person contributes to make a household head happier ( \\np=0.059  ) because this person not only can provide free help \\nto raise children (Dunifon 2012), but also can teach others on living experiences, as it \\nhappens in Asian societies (Rho 2014).\\nRegarding the second group of covariates, household heads are happier when they \\nearn complete elementary education or higher. As a proxy of health status, being obese makes household heads less happy. A similar direction in the effect is obtained when \\neither the household head works and for an additional working hour. All these four \\neffects are not statistically significant but are consistent with previous studies (Alesina \\net\\xa0al. 2004; Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Graham and Felton 2005; Graham and Pet-\\ntinato 2002; among others). In a sense of work-life balance, when household heads are \\nmore satisfied with their primary jobs, they are happier ( \\np<0.001  ). Although there is \\nno evidence for this claim in a rural context, there is for an urban environment (Nylenna \\net\\xa0al. 2005) and consistent with a meta-analytic finding (Bowling et\\xa0al. 2010).\\nFinally, when analyzing the third group of covariates, there are plenty of evidence \\nwhich support the presence of a social network in personal lives (Jiang and George 2015). Having at least one friend to talk to, to share experiences, good and bad moments \\nin a daily or weekly basis, indeed, generate happier household heads. In the very poor \\nPeru, the importance of God adds a spiritual environment which contributes to increase \\nhappiness of household heads ( \\np=0.0604  ). Analysis for multicollinearity by exami-\\nnation of eigenvalues and condition indexes revealed multicollinearity problem is not \\nsevere. Examination of variance inflation factors was omitted due to multiple coefficient \\nof determination is low. Finally, the null hypothesis for homoscedasticity failed to be rejected, \\n/u1D7122\\n(248)=196.52  , p=0.9931 .\\nThere have been several variables that have influenced happiness scores. Among \\nthese, it has been considered multidimensional poverty of the head of household, age, sex, marital status, having one child at home or living with an elder person or two, education, working hours, social net size and strength, religiosity to affect in the regres-\\nsion analysis. For starters, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) indicated that higher income \\nincreases positive affect. That analysis goes along the results presented, because more \\npoverty, used as another proxy of objective welfare, reduces happiness. Considering \\nAlesina et\\xa0al. (2004), age resulted in a negative effect on happiness, and that is congru-ent with the results of this study. According to Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005), being female \\nincreases happiness, but this is not the case for the very poor Peru, because of discrimi-\\nnation is still very present (Sulmont 2012). Furthermore, Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) found that married people report rising well-being, and the results of this study \\nreach the same conclusion. Alesina et\\xa0al. (2004) pointed out that children seem to bring preoccupations, stress and hard work and, thus, reduces happiness. Alesina’s study was \\nconducted in Europe and the USA. In Peru, there is a different view among creation of a \\nfamily. Thus, this study partially differs from previous literature because only one child makes household heads happier but two does not.\\n1088 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nFinally, as Waldinger (2017)4 stated, social groups are powerful health promoters, then \\nthe conclusion from the presented analysis when stating social net size and strength have \\na positive impact on happiness is congruent. Following the subject of religion (Kahneman \\nand Deaton 2010), religion has a substantial effect on increasing positive affect and reduc-\\ning stress, so this is congruent to the analysis and obtaining a positive effect of religion on \\nhappiness.\\n5.3.2  Profile of\\xa0those who are very poor and\\xa0happy\\nIn this negative association between poverty and happiness for the very poor household \\nheads, four scenarios can be generated: happy and very poor, happy and not very poor, \\nunhappy and not very poor, and unhappy and very poor; and one important question arose: \\nWhat is the profile of those who consider themselves as happy and very poor household heads in comparison to those who feel unhappy and very poor? As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3, three \\nfindings are quite relevant to point out. First, 26% of the happy and very poor household heads (n = 131) reported a lower proportion of no education at all in comparison to 44% \\nof the unhappy and very poor (n = 178). Second, the happy and very poor ones reported \\na higher number of people they would ask for help in\\xa0situations of crisis (8.12) in com-parison to those who are unhappy very poor (3.41). Finally, regarding the social network \\nstrength in which a household head can talk to friends on a daily or weekly basis, the net is \\nstronger for the happy and very poor (34%) in comparison to those who are unhappy and very poor (22%). This difference is due to the cultural values of people living in the Peru-\\nvian Andes (Walshe and Argumedo 2016).\\n5.4  A partial consistent relationship between\\xa0life satisfaction and\\xa0poverty\\nThe main purpose of this section is to identify if the multidimensional poverty index \\n(MPI*) is consistently related to happiness when using two different operationalizations. \\nThus, two model settings which differs in the measurement nature of the dependent vari-\\nable are developed and controlled for a similar set of covariates in both cases. The first one considers the happiness standardized scores (HHS) which is a continuous score obtained \\nfrom the endorsed ordinal responses of household heads and transformed with item \\nresponse theory techniques. The second operationalization considers only one single ques-\\ntion with a 0–20 scale to measure happiness as life satisfaction and labeled as Contentment \\nof Whole of Life (CWL).\\nThere is a negative association between the life satisfaction scores and the multidimen-\\nsional poverty index for the very poor household heads. This indicates that the higher the poverty index is reported, the lower the level of contentment of whole life. Although the null hypothesis of no correlation was rejected ( \\np=0.0077  ), the strength of the relationship \\nis very weak ( r=− 0.1157 ).\\nTable\\xa0 4 reports the results obtained for both model settings. Columns (1) and (5) display \\nresults for the models including only the poverty index for household heads. As expected, MPI* is negatively correlated with happiness under both operationalizations, both results are statistically significant.

Overall, these effect sizes are small and negligible -in terms of Cohen’s f2\\n—for specifications (1) and (5), respectively (Cohen 1988). Thus, in columns (1) and (5), effect sizes account for 4% and 1% of the happiness operationalizations variances, respec-\\ntively. For a Cohen’s \\nf2 to be considered a small effect size, it must be at least 2% but not \\ngreater than 15%.\\nIn the overall process of adding covariates, the control variables of happiness show a \\nmore consistent relationship with the first operationalization (HSS) in comparison to the second one (CWL). Despite MPI* lost statistical significance in specifications (3) and \\n(4), the direction of the relationship remained negative. In addition, only the variable ‘two \\nadults older than sixty at home’ changed the expected direction of the relationship, see \\nFig. 3  Profile of the happy very poor (HVP) and unhappy very poor (UVP) household heads based on a \\ngroup of traits. *The difference between these two groups is statistically significant at /u1D6FC=0.05\\n1090 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nspecification (3) in Table\\xa0 4. This variation could be due to the presence of multicollin-\\nearity identified previously. Although was not severe, it certainly can generate incorrect \\nestimations. Regarding ‘contentment with the whole life’, certainly MPI* lost statistical \\nsignificance since specification (6) but what matters is the persistent change in the direc-tion of the relationship, see specifications (7) and (8) in Table\\xa0 4. Moreover, five variables \\nhave incongruent estimated coefficient signs when analyzing the specification (8): ‘female’, ‘only one adult over sixty at home’, ‘obese’, ‘self-employed’, ‘social net strength (daily)’, \\nand ‘reliable friends’. It brings some concerns how the direction of the relationship of these \\nvariables with CWL remains inconsistent and contrary to what was expected.\\nFinally, examination of the residuals with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normal-\\nity revealed that the null hypothesis fails to be rejected consistently for HSS models but is rejected for all specifications under CWL. Both full models for HSS and CWL -see speci-fications (4) and (8)- accounts for a certain level of the dependent variable variability, 20% \\nand 18%, respectively.\\n6  Conclusions\\nThis study sought to address three questions. The first question investigated the distribu-\\ntion of happiness scores among the Peruvian very poor household heads who live in the \\nfive poorest districts. One of the best contributions of this paper is the application of the \\nOHQ to measure the latent trait of happiness. The eight items of the short version revealed that, holding the assumption of an underlying latent continuum for happiness, the scores \\ndistribution is symmetric. When categorizing the variable, 66% of the very poor household \\nheads are unhappy. This finding is important because not only the measurement instrument captures different timing aspects of happiness (past, present, and future), but also due to the \\napplication of IRT, measurement error reduces.\\nThe second question this study investigated was if there was a meaningful relationship \\nbetween happiness and poverty among the Peruvian very poor household heads. When comparing happiness and poverty ( \\nr=− 0.1831  ), the result shows an opposite direction \\nto the paradox stated by Graham and Pettinato (2002) and Lora et\\xa0al. (2010). In both stud-ies, authors claimed while poor people are happy, those with distinctive income gains are \\nfrustrated. However, even in a context of poverty, there are household heads who are very poor and unhappy, as well. Several control variables influenced on this relationship. Traits \\nsuch as age, sex, and being married, also seen as a proxy of friends, revealed that happiness \\ndepends on them, equally or more. Similarly, to these objective traits, subjective character -\\nistics can influence the level of happiness of a person. If individuals experience good qual-ity of human relationships with family, friends and acquaintances, then they internalize that in moments of need, they have their own personal social protection net (Li and Kanazawa \\n2016). In this regard, perception of getting help plays an important role, the more people to \\nask for help, the more happiness scale reported. This help can be divine as well, the pres-ence and importance of God in quite a religious country as Peru is, contributes to increase \\nlevels of happiness (Marzal et\\xa0al. 2002; Valenzuela et\\xa0al. 2009). In fact, based on this sur -\\nvey study, 90% of very poor household heads in Peru indicated God was very important in their lives.\\nFrom the negative relationship between happiness and poverty, previously mentioned, \\ntwo groups were distinguished: household heads who are happy and very poor and house-\\nhold heads who are unhappy and very poor, to build up their profiles. Mainly, happy and \\n1091\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\nvery poor household heads trust in more people than the other group. Parallelly, not having \\nfriends and talking to them daily could derive in what Waldinger (2017) denominated, the \\ncrisis of loneliness.5\\nThe third question this study investigated was whether the results from the second \\nresearch question were consistent to the classic measurement of happiness (one single question regarding life satisfaction). Essentially this question tried to answer if there was \\nexternal validity of the results to a different measurement technique (operationalization) of the outcome variable. When comparing life satisfaction and poverty, the relationship was \\nnegative and very weak ( \\nr=− 0.1157  ). However, when controlling for other variables, this \\nrelationship turned out positive.\\nAcknowledgements We are extremely grateful for comments and advice from Enver Tarazona, Juan Fran-\\ncisco Castro, Cynthia Sanborn, and Edward B.

It is not that\\nthese empirical exercises have not been worthwhile. Certainly, we know a\\ngreat deal more about the state of inequality and poverty in the world thanused to be the case. But there is room for more conceptual questioning and\\ngreater foundational scrutiny at this time, both for reexamining old problems\\n(they rarely go away) and for addressing new questions that have emerged in\\nthe contemporary world. Indeed, the practical world is a constant source of\\nconceptual challenge, and it is right that we should try to reassess our con-cepts and ideas in the light of the manifest problems that empirical work\\nidenti\\ufb01es.\\nLet me illustrate with the recent factual debates on the state of inequal-\\nity and poverty in China\\u2014a subject that has engaged much high-powered\\nattention in the last few years. Over the last two decades China has had analtogether exceptional record of rapid economic growth, which has boosted\\nthe country\\u2019s average income faster than anywhere else in the world. The im-\\npact of China\\u2019s fast economic growth can be seen also in the swift reductionin China of the number of poor people\\u2014the population below what is\\nagreed to be the minimally acceptable income level. Although the exact esti-\\nmates of the extent of the decline of poverty in China remain an important\\n30\\nConceptualizing and Measuring Poverty 31\\nsubject of debate as well as further empirical research, the fact of a sweeping\\npoverty reduction is not under dispute. In fact, China is recognized to be the\\nprincipal factor behind whatever downward trend that can be seen in the in-\\ncidence of poverty in the world as a whole. Indeed, the trend of world pov-\\nerty looks totally different depending on whether or not China is included in\\nthe world statistics.\\nDespite such success, there are reasons for concern that demand further\\ninvestigation and scrutiny. First, the poverty-removing character of Chineseeconomic expansion was much sharper in the early post-reform period than\\nit was later. Second, although the concern in the \\ufb01eld of poverty is compar-\\native deceleration, in the related but distinct perspective of inequality, theproblem takes the form of an actual increase in income inequality. For ex-\\nample, the Gini coef\\ufb01cient, a commonly used measure of the extent to which\\nthe actual income distribution differs from a hypothetical distribution inwhich each person receives an identical share, seems to have jumped from\\n0.382 to 0.452 between 1988 and 1995, a remarkably speedy increase in light\\nof international historical experience.\\n1\\nThere have been other estimates as well, and for slightly different peri-\\nods, but the basic result that there has been quite a large increase in income\\ninequality in China seems hard to dispute. For example, Ravi Kanbur and\\nXiaobo Zhang (2001), using a somewhat different method, calculate that the\\nGini coef\\ufb01cient for income inequality in China went up from 0.217 in 1985\\nto 0.303 in 1999\\u2014again a remarkably big jump.2Kanbur and Zhang \\ufb01nd\\nsimilar results also with another measure of inequality, namely, a \\u201cgeneral-\\nized entropy index\\u201d from a class of measures that Theil (1967) \\ufb01rst explored\\n(another measure on which I will comment further, later on in this chapter).\\nThis development has a profound in\\ufb02uence not just for China, but also\\nfor the world.3Again, concentrating on the Gini coef\\ufb01cient as a measure of\\ninequality, Branko Milanovic (2002) \\ufb01nds, using household surveys across\\nthe world, that the Gini coef\\ufb01cient for the world as a whole (based on a\\nbroad sampling of countries) has gone up from 0.628 in 1988 to 0.660 in\\n1993. In explaining the causation of this retrograde movement, Milanovic\\nidenti\\ufb01es the powerful in\\ufb02uence of the contrast between the \\u201cslow growth ofrural per capita incomes\\u201d in China (among other populous Asian countries)\\ncompared with the \\u201cfast growth of urban China\\u201d (along with the OECD\\ncountries). Indeed, the rural-urban contrast in Chinese income growth alone\\nis responsible for a sizeable share of the rise of the world Gini coef\\ufb01cient. \\n32 Amartya Sen\\nSo there is an important issue to be addressed here in discussing poverty and\\ninequality in China. The continued great achievements in income growth\\nseem to have been accompanied, in the more recent years, with an inten-\\nsi\\ufb01cation of inequality, and even the tremendous accomplishment in poverty\\nreduction has been uneven over time and regionally disparate.\\ncritical evaluation issues: space and measures\\nThe statistics with which the inequality literature is concerned have been pri-\\nmarily that of incomes. This focus is the case with the recent Chinese discus-sions on inequality and poverty as well. The \\u201cspace\\u201d of incomes has been the\\nprincipal\\u2014often the unique\\u2014focus of attention of those who have to exam-\\nine the trend of inequality and poverty in the world, including these trends in\\nChina. The dominance of the income perspective has been remarkably large\\nin empirical works on inequality and poverty.\\nWithin that space of incomes, the speci\\ufb01c measure that has been most\\nwidely used is the Gini coef\\ufb01cient. This is especially so in the literature relatedto Chinese inequality, even though it is sometimes supplemented by other\\nmeasures, such as the generalized entropy index. The choice of an exact mea-\\nsure is a subject matter that needs to be identi\\ufb01ed for further scrutiny.\\nThe measure of poverty most commonly used in examining poverty in the\\nworld in general, and speci\\ufb01cally in assessing poverty in China, is the head-count measure of poverty. It has been used both in terms of the absolute num-ber of the \\u201cpoor\\u201d people below the poverty line, and in proportionate terms:\\nas the fraction of the total population who have below-poverty-line income.\\nThis measure has sometimes been supplemented by other measures, such as\\nthe aggregate size of the income shortfall of the poor (expressed as a fraction\\ntotal income), and also \\u201caggregate squared poverty gap\\u201d (P\\n2) as the propor-\\ntionate sum of the squared gaps between the poverty line threshold and the\\nactual income of poor persons respectively (a measure that was, in fact, de-\\nvised by Cornell economists Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke).4\\nQuestions can be raised both about (1) the appropriateness of the space\\nof incomes, and about (2) the speci\\ufb01c measures used in the income space. It\\nis useful to address these conceptual issues not just to see how robust the re-cent \\ufb01ndings are, but also\\u2014and indeed much more importantly\\u2014to place\\nfuture assessments of inequality and poverty in the world, including in China,\\non a robust intellectual footing. We have to see how the choice of space and\\nConceptualizing and Measuring Poverty 33\\nthat of measure tallies with the motivation that makes us interested in evalu-\\nating inequality and poverty in the \\ufb01rst place. The measurement of inequal-\\nity and poverty has to be in line with the motivating concerns related to\\nequity and justice.\\nspace: incomes and capabilities\\nI begin with the choice of space, that is, the determination of the variables \\nin terms of which inequality and poverty are to be assessed. Is income the\\nright space? In fact, in many ways it must be so. Inequality of incomes can-not but be relevant to evaluative assessment, because income is a general-\\npurpose means the shortage of which can reduce a person to serious dep-\\nrivation. Furthermore, in explaining major economic catastrophes, sudden\\ndownturns of incomes of the vulnerable population have great explanatory\\npower.\\nThis connection is well illustrated, for example, by the recent \\u201cAsian\\neconomic crisis,\\u201d beginning in 1997, which af\\ufb02icted countries such as South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand, where the income decline of those who lost\\njobs (and who had no social security support) served as the prime mover for\\nthe tremendous hardship that ensued. Similarly, the Russian economic crisisof the late 1980s and the 1990s with its botched attempt at sudden privati-\\nzation and marketization, can be, to a considerable extent, explained by how\\nincomes took a sudden downturn.\\nTo turn to a different\\u2014and an enormously distressing\\u2014matter, in a\\ntroubled period in China\\u2019s own history, in the causal process that led to thestarvation and massive mortality that followed the failure of the \\u201cGreat Leap\\nForward,\\u201d a central role was played by declines in incomes and entitlements,\\nproperly estimated. Although a fall in food output and availability was a ma-jor factor behind the sharp drop in entitlements (as is the case in some famines\\nbut not in others), a fuller understanding of the pattern of deprivation and its\\ndistribution over the population requires us to go beyond the food availabil-ity statistics (while taking due note of them). Indeed, failures of entitlement\\nclosely linked with declines in incomes and economic solvency provide amore effective perspective on starvation than concentration on food alone\\ncan provide.\\n5\\nThe entitlement approach to famines takes food supply to be one factor\\namong many that can in\\ufb02uence a collapse of entitlements and drastically\\n34 Amartya Sen\\nreduce the command that vulnerable groups have over food needed for con-\\nsumption and survival. The command over food depends on income levels,\\nappropriately assessed, including taking note inter alia of the in\\ufb02uence of\\nproduction (including food production) and distribution arrangements (in-\\ncluding that of food). It is important to see food availability as one in\\ufb02uence\\namong others that affect entitlements, without its being the only in\\ufb02uence,nor necessarily the most important causal factor. Because this point is often\\nmissed (and it is often wrongly presumed that entitlements must be indepen-\\ndent of food availability), the fact that food availability \\ufb01gures among other\\nfactors in the determination of entitlements is worth stressing.\\n6\\nThe analysis of Justin Lin and Dennis Yang (2000) has shown precisely\\nhow the perspective of entitlements, in which incomes (when they are ade-quately characterized) play a major role, can provide an illuminating expla-\\nnation of the pattern and intensity of the deprivation that occurred in China\\nduring 1959\\u20131961.\\n7No matter what other space we use for assessing in-\\nequality and poverty, there will almost always be room for discriminatinguse of incomes and income-related statistics, particularly in explaining ma-\\njor deprivations related to economic causes.\\nHowever, having said that, it is also necessary to ask whether the \\nspace of incomes, despite its relevance, can really be the appropriate infor-mational basis for assessing equity and social justice in general, and if it is\\ninadequate, why it is so? These questions relate to our understanding ofwhat the underlying goals of development are, and how, in particular, the\\nquality of human life and substantive freedoms enjoyed by people can be\\nbest assessed. Whereas income is merely one of the means of good living, we\\nhave reason enough to look directly at the quality of life that people are able\\nto lead, and the freedom they enjoy to live the way they would like. If life\\nconsists of various things that people are able to do or be (such as being ableto live long, to be in good health, to be able to read and write, and so on),\\nthen it is the capability to function that has to be put at the center stage of \\nassessment.\\nIt is precisely the distinction between incomes, on the one hand, and\\nwell-being and freedom of persons, on the other, that drives a wedge betweenincome information and the evaluative foundations of justice and equity.\\n8\\nNot only can the interest in capability in\\ufb02uence the assessment of inequality,but also poverty has to be seen, in this perspective, as failures of certain ba-\\nsic capabilities (rather than of lowness of income per se).\\nConceptualizing and Measuring Poverty 35\\nIndeed, in the fourth century BC, Aristotle had pointed out, at the very\\nbeginning of his Nicomachean Ethics, that income and wealth are only in-\\nstrumentally valued, and we have to go deeper to understand what makes\\nhuman life rich and human freedoms effective. As he put it, \\u201cwealth is evi-\\ndently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of\\nsomething else.\\u201d9That distinction had, in fact, been noted, in one way or\\nanother, in other ancient civilizations as well, including China (for example\\nin the writings of Confucius). Similarly, in India, Gautama Buddha\\u2019s famous\\nquest in search of enlightenment, two centuries earlier than Aristotle, was di-\\nrectly linked to his recognition that income and wealth (which, as a prince\\nof a prosperous kingdom, he plentifully had) could not prevent, for anyone,the adversities of illness, old age, and death, nor the penalty of ignorance, il-\\nliteracy, and lack of enlightenment.\\n10\\nIf we see development in terms of enhancement of human living and the\\nfreedom to live the kind of life that we have reason to value, then there is astrong case for focusing on \\u201cfunctionings\\u201d and the \\u201ccapability\\u201d to function.\\nThe capabilities of relevance are not only those that relate to avoiding pre-\\nmature mortality, being in good health, being schooled and educated, and\\nother such basic concerns, but also various social achievements, including\\u2014as Adam Smith (1776) emphasized\\u2014being able to appear in public without\\nshame and being able to take part in the life of the community.\\n11\\nIt cannot, of course, be doubted that having a higher income will, given\\nother things , help the achievement of a larger capability to function. But in-\\ncome is only one input among many (our capabilities also depend, for ex-\\nample, on social and political opportunities), and furthermore, given the\\nlevel of income, our capability prospects depend also on personal factors\\n(such as proneness to inherited diseases) and on the environment (includingthe epidemiological environment) in which people live.\\ncapability poverty and relative deprivation\\nThe connection between income and capability is also made more complex\\nby the relevance of relative deprivation. As Adam Smith noted, the social ca-\\npabilities may depend on a person\\u2019s relative income vis-\\u00e0-vis those of others\\nwith whom he or she interacts. A person\\u2019s ability to be clothed appropriately\\n(or to have other items of consumption goods that have some visibility or social use), given the standards of the society in which he or she lives, may\\n36 Amartya Sen\\nbe crucial for the capability to mix with others in that society. This relates\\ndirectly to relative income vis-\\u00e0-vis the general level of prosperity in that\\ncommunity. A relative deprivation in terms of income can, thus, lead to ab-\\nsolute deprivation in terms of capabilities, and in this sense, the problems of\\npoverty and inequality are closely interlinked. For example, being relatively\\npoor in a rich country can be a great capability handicap, even when one\\u2019sabsolute income is high in world standards. In a generally opulent country,\\nmore income is needed to buy enough commodities to achieve the same so-\\ncial functioning. This foundational idea relates to a number of contemporaryconcerns, for example \\u201csocial exclusion.\\u201d\\n12\\nSome implications of Smith\\u2019s focus on relative income in assessing \\npoverty are worth separating out because of their extensive reach. First, because the absolute deprivation of social capabilities depends on relative\\ndeprivation of incomes, clearly the assessment of poverty in the space of \\ncapabilities cannot be divorced from the extent of income inequality. This\\nconnection indicates that the increasingly common global tendency in pub-lic discussion (and sometimes in public policy analysis) to argue in favor of\\nan exclusive concentration on poverty removal, rather than being concerned\\nalso about inequality, is intellectually hard to sustain. Although it is easy \\nto see that income poverty and income inequality are distinct phenomena,\\nnevertheless capability poverty relates inseparably to income inequality. An often-articulated political attitude, which takes the form of saying, \\u201cI do\\ncare about poverty, but don\\u2019t give a damn about inequality,\\u201d not only re\\ufb02ects\\na remarkably narrow approach to morality but also raises issues of incon-sistency, given the causal linkages that make inequality and poverty so \\ninterdependent.\\nSecond, Smithian reasoning indicates why poverty is hard to eradicate\\njust by raising the average level of income, without also addressing issues of\\ninequality of incomes. In particular, the phenomenon of poverty in richcountries can be better understood through the perspective of relative depri-\\nvation. Adam Smith analyzed the relevance of relative position vis-\\u00e0-vis oth-\\ners in society in the following way:\\nA linen shirt, for example is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The\\nGreeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had nolinen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable\\nday-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without linen shirt, the\\nConceptualizing and Measuring Poverty 37\\nwant of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty\\nwhich, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct.Custom, in the same manner, had rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England. The poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed toappear in public without them. (Smith 1776, Vol. 2, Book V, ch. 2)\\nSimilarly, today, a person in New York may well suffer from poverty de-\\nspite having a level of income that would make him or her immune from\\npoverty in Bangladesh or Ethiopia. This is not only because the capabilities\\nthat are taken to be minimally basic tend to change as a country becomes\\nricher, but also because even for the same level of capability, the needed min-\\nimal income may itself rise, along with the incomes of others in the commu-nity. For example, in order to take part in the life of the community, or for\\nchildren to be able to communicate with others in the same school, the\\nbundle of commodities needed may include a telephone, a television, a car,\\nand so on, in New York, in a way that would not apply in Addis or in Dhaka\\n(where an adult may be able to participate in social affairs and children cantalk to each other without these implements).\\nThus, even the same minimal capability has varying commodity de-\\nmands and divergent requirements of minimal income in different societies,involving systematic connection with incomes of others in the community in\\nwhich a person lives. One further implication of this linkage is that given the\\npeer pressure that operates in favor of social capabilities (often at the expense\\nof other needs), even physical deprivation, such as undernourishment, can\\noccur in richer countries at levels of family income at which elementary nu-tritional deprivation would be very rarely seen in poorer countries. The so-\\ncial pressure operating particularly on adult consumption patterns also helps\\nto explain the much discussed odd phenomenon of \\u201chunger in America,\\u201d\\nparticularly given the levels of income of families with hungry members (of-\\nten the children), which can be much above income levels at which hungercan be observed in poorer economies.\\n13\\nThird, the pivotal role of the consumption patterns of others in the same\\ncommunity, or in a group with which a person interacts, also indicates why\\npoverty cannot but be assessed in purely individual terms. The understanding\\nthat no person is an island is quite central to the assessment of poverty, and\\ncorrespondingly, to the appropriate evaluation of the bite and reach of in-\\nequality. I shall have to come back to this issue when discussing the axiomatic\\n38 Amartya Sen\\ndemands on formal measures of inequality and poverty, in particular the\\nrequirement of decomposability.\\ncapability and equity in china\\nHow does the choice of space affect our assessment of inequality and pov-\\nerty in China? Involvement in the space of some elementary functionings and\\ncapabilities has been an important feature of Chinese economic policy right\\nfrom the founding of communist China. Through a visionary commitment\\nto basic education, elementary health care, and social epidemiology, Chinamade early achievements in levels of schooling, literacy, basic health, and\\nlongevity that far outshone those of many countries with much higher lev-\\nels of GNP or real national income per head.\\nThis early accomplishment of China related, from one perspective, to\\nthe average of the country, but it also re\\ufb02ected a sharp decline in the tradi-tional inequalities in education, health, and life expectancy as well as a sharp\\nreduction in the deprivation of basic economic capabilities (and in this sense,\\nof capability poverty). It is worth recollecting also that these achievements\\npredate the economic reforms, because China already had an extended base\\nof elementary education and basic health care when the reforms were initi-ated in 1979. Income poverty still remained very high, because China\\u2019s real\\neconomic growth was not particularly comprehensive or spectacular before\\nthe reforms, but it would be a serious mistake not to note the great achieve-ments of China in reducing capability poverty and capability inequality in\\nthe pre-reform period.\\nAs it happens, when the economic reforms were ultimately introduced,\\nChina\\u2019s astonishing performance was inter alia drawing on what it had al-\\nready achieved in health and education, because its economic expansion isgreatly facilitated by the educational achievements and quality of health of\\nthe working population.\\n14Nevertheless, there is no question that the pre-\\nreform achievements in health and education, accomplished by 1979, badlyneeded the supplement of the enhancement of real incomes, because many\\nother capabilities depend greatly on economic means. There is also no doubt\\nthat rapid economic growth\\u2014with fast decline in income poverty\\u2014after\\n1979 would not have occurred but for a radical economic reform. It is in thislight that the poverty reduction in post-reform China, with its particular \\nfocus on income poverty, has to be appropriately assessed. The post-reform\\nConceptualizing and Measuring Poverty 39\\nexperience of China, especially in the early years, was both drawing on pre-\\nreform achievements and also changing its special involvement with health\\nand education, compared with income levels and the economic means of\\nfamilies and individuals.\\nThere is a case, I believe, for reexamining the focus of research on in-\\nequality and poverty in contemporary China, with greater concentration ondisparities and deprivations of basic capabilities. There is a very strong case\\nfor supplementing the powerful work that has occurred\\u2014and is continuing\\nto occur\\u2014on income inequality and income poverty with a similarly exten-\\nsive investigation of the trends of inequality and poverty in such variables as\\nmortality, morbidity, education, and other indicators of capability that mayor may not relate closely to income inequality and income poverty. To some\\nextent this investigation is already happening, and even in this book, there\\nare a number of chapters on issues that link closely with capability inequal-ity and capability deprivation. It would be very useful to integrate a capa-\\nbility-based overall assessment of the attainments and adversities in contem-\\nporary China.\\nI might mention that there may be some prima facie reason to think that\\nChina\\u2019s situation can be an important area of investigation. The rise in in-come in the post-reform period has been so exceptionally fast that the slow-\\nness of progress in other areas has tended to receive comparatively little at-\\ntention. For example in the \\ufb01eld of life expectancy, when China introduced\\neconomic reforms in 1979, China was ahead of India by about 14 years\\n(with a life expectancy at birth in India of around 54 years and in China of about 68 years). The gap seems now to have narrowed to perhaps 7 years\\nor so (with India\\u2019s life expectancy at 64 years and China\\u2019s at 71 years). \\nOf course, it gets harder to expand life expectancy further as the absolute\\nlevel rises. But nevertheless it is perhaps of some signi\\ufb01cance that the state of\\nKerala in India (with a good educational base and an extensive system ofhealth services, and effective multi-party, participatory politics) now has sub-\\nstantially higher life expectancy than China, namely 74 years (with 72 years\\nfor men and 76 years for women), even though in 1979, Kerala was well be-hind China. Similarly, while Kerala had an infant mortality comparable to\\nChina\\u2019s around 1979, that rate has continued to drop in Kerala in a way it\\nhas not quite happened in China, so that today Kerala\\u2019s infant mortality rate\\nof 10 per thousand is about a third of China\\u2019s infant mortality of around 30\\nper thousand.\\n15\\n40 Amartya Sen\\nAlthough these are mainly aggregative statistics, they have proximate\\nconnections with capability poverty, and indirect ones even with capability\\ninequalities. Also, a number of policy questions can be better evaluated with\\nmore explicit and de\\ufb01nitive studies on the inequality and poverty of basic\\ncapabilities, and these questions could aid the making of public policy. The\\n\\ufb01nancing of medical care and health insurance may be one such \\ufb01eld. I shouldperhaps also add that one of the positive in\\ufb02uences on the success of health\\ncare and the reach of school education (especially for girls) in Kerala is the na-\\nture of public discussion on this issue. So the issue of public participation is\\nnot only of interest as a constitutive component of a basic capability, but also\\nas a strong in\\ufb02uence on other capabilities, related to longevity, health, andeducation.\\ndecomposability: gini coef\\ufb01cient \\nand other measures\\nLet me now move away from the issue of space (and the importance of ca-\\npabilities) and come back to the more familiar income perspective that is\\ncentral to so much of the current work on inequality and poverty. As was\\nmentioned earlier, no matter what other perspectives are introduced and\\npursued in this \\ufb01eld, interest remains in the assessment of income inequality\\nand income poverty. It is in this context particularly worth asking whetherthe speci\\ufb01c measures of income inequality and income poverty that are stan-\\ndardly used are indeed appropriate. It is also relevant to inquire whether the\\ndistinction as well as the connections between incomes and capabilities have\\nany bearing on this complex question.\\nAs I noted earlier, the most commonly used measure of income inequal-\\nity in China\\u2014and indeed also elsewhere\\u2014is the Gini coef\\ufb01cient. Some econ-omists have argued that this measure is defective because it is not decom-\\nposable, and many applied economists hold a quite well-developed opinion\\nthat non-decomposable measures should be, as far as possible, avoided.\\nWhat exactly, we must ask, is decomposability?

Themultidimensional approach operationalized here in the structuralequation framework suggests that the multidimensionality of povertyhypothesis holds for the population in Kathmandu, Nepal, includingeconomic well-being, capability, and social inclusion. While all of thesedimensions are integral, the capability dimension appears to be highly\\ninfluential, affecting every other poverty dimension.

First, linking poverty with the\\nbroader concepts of freedom and human rights, the capability approach\\nsuggests that poverty and well-being are functions of capabilities. Drawingon the works of Amartya Sen (1987, 1992, 1999), this capability notion\\npostulates that poverty results from a lack of capability to \\u2018function\\u2019 or to\\n\\u2018achieve\\u2019 well-being, where well-being is defined as the \\u2018\\u2018ends\\u2019\\u2019 and\\ncapability as the \\u2018\\u2018means\\u2019\\u2019 to achieve it (United Nations Development\\nProgramme [UNDP], 2000a,b). With the assumption that improvements inanthropometric measures are possible only with individual capabilities,\\nproponents of the capability approach argue that education, health, and\\nethnic and gender disparities \\u2014 while broader societal and structuralforces help determine them \\u2014 indicate one\\u2019s status of poverty and human\\nwell-being (Muellbauer, 1987; Sen, 1992).\\nSecond, poverty research has greatly benefited from social inclusion\\nstudies, focusing on social processes that inhibit people from acquiring\\nresources needed to avoid poverty (Silver, 1994, 1995; European\\nFoundation, 1995; International Institute of Labour Studies, 1996;Strobel, 1996; Cannan, 1997; de Haan and Maxwell, 1998). While these\\nstudies attempt to deal with broader issues of human well-being, findings\\nthat social inclusion and poverty greatly reinforce each other have\\ntremendous implications for poverty analysis (Gore et al. , 1995;\\nFigueroa et al. , 1996; International Institute of Labour Studies, 1996;\\nGore and Figueiredo, 1997). Following the social inclusion approach,\\nindividuals and households can be excluded in three broadly construed\\ndimensions \\u2014 economic, political, and civic/cultural (Strobel, 1996;Atkinson, 1998; Evans, 1998; Taylor, 1999). An exclusion from economic\\nactivities in the labor market, financial resources, and the formal sector\\neconomy, for example, can effectively deny one the needed economic\\nopportunities. A lack of participation in political activities such as securing\\nvoting rights, voting, partisan activities, and holding political positions islikely to block access to political resources as well as citizenship rights.\\nFurthermore, participation in civic/cultural activities enables one to benefit\\nfrom extended social networks and ties that are essential, for example, in\\ngetting good jobs, securing credits, and sending children to better schools.\\nWidespread arguments surface for the application of a multidimen-\\nsional approach to poverty (Ravallion, 1996; Wagle, 2002). While\\neconomic well-being, capability, and economic, political, and civic/cultural\\ninclusion are integral parts of a comprehensive, multidimensional concept\\nof poverty, proper operationalization is still lacking (Oyen, 1995; Wagle,2002). Going beyond limited multidimensionality (Ravallion, 1996;\\nBurchardt et al. , 2002; Tsui, 2002; Dewilde, 2004),\\n1this analysis integrates\\nall five major dimensions of poverty in a truly comprehensive frameworkU. Wagle\\n302\\nand applies in Kathmandu. Given many alternative ways to actually use the\\ninformation to derive poverty outcomes, it creates a platform for further\\ndiscussions on a more refined, policy relevant application of thismultidimensional approach.\\nFollowing this introduction, this paper presents in the following\\nsection the overall policy context in Kathmandu and explains the dataset.\\nSection three poses major questions and hypotheses, while section fourdevelops and estimates the multidimensional model. Section five presents\\nresults with their general implications, while the final section concludes\\nwith discussions and suggestions for future research.\\nContext and data set\\nKathmandu Metropolitan City, the geographic focus of this paper,witnessed a thriving economy in the 1990s. The emerging tourism\\nindustry and development of the city as a major commercial and\\nadministrative center in Nepal, among other things, contributed to anannual income growth of well over 5%, which is much higher than in other\\nparts of the country (UNDP/Nepal, 1998, 2002). Kathmandu represents\\none of many urban centers in the developing world where increasing\\nurbanization and economic liberalization have not benefited the masses\\nand the incidence of poverty has remained considerably high. Clearly, thishas caused an alarm among policy-makers seeking to create a tide to lift all\\nboats.\\nThere is a paucity of studies that examine this complex situation,\\nhowever. The focus of the extant poverty research, for example, has\\nbeen on macroeconomic issues (World Bank, 1991; National Planning\\nCommission, 1992; UNDP/Nepal, 1998) or issues concerning some specificpopulation segments (Baker et al. , 1997; Weiss, 1999). As elsewhere, more\\nspecific studies conducted primarily at the national level have embraced\\nincome or consumption approaches (Central Bureau of Statistics, 1997;\\nWorld Bank, 2003a). Critics question the validity of these approaches that\\nshow significant improvement in poverty reduction\\n2at a time in which the\\nnine-year Communist (Maoist) insurgency claiming over 12 000 lives has\\nbrought all major activities to a standstill, thereby effectively crippling the\\neconomy, making all types of elections long overdue, and establishing a\\ncomplete anarchy in the country.\\nThis study investigates poverty in Kathmandu, using data derived from\\na random survey of 625 households3conducted in 2002 and 2003. The\\nsurvey gathered data on a variety of household well-being issues through\\ninterviews with householders or other knowledgeable members on\\nhouseholds\\u2019 economic, social, and political dynamics. Sampling involveddelineating some 224 geographic clusters out of the 35 city-wards and,\\nwith the help of an Arial map, selecting two to four households from each\\ncluster depending on its size and population. A group of eight university\\nstudents identified the sampled households out of the planned sample ofMultidimensional Poverty Measurement\\n303\\n672 households and interviewed them, using a standardized survey\\ninstrument. In case of failure to interview people from the chosen\\nhouseholds, the interviewers interviewed householders from adjacent\\nhouses. A number of measures were adopted to maintain validity and\\nreliability of the data including a balanced gender composition of\\ninterviewers, appropriate interviewer training, and standardization of\\nboth questions asked and the interview process.\\nThe resulting sample data compared reasonably well with the\\npopulation census data collected in 2001. Sample proportions on sex,\\nage group, religion, region, and type of dwelling, for example, lay within a\\n6% margin around the population proportions (Central Bureau of\\nStatistics, 2002; Kathmandu Metropolitan City, 2003). Similarly, the\\nsample average for household size, one of the defining characteristics ofpopulation, was just 0.39 greater than the population average. Although\\nthe data set was fairly comprehensive, this analysis uses indicators of\\neconomic well-being, capability, and social inclusion as and when\\nappropriate. A list of variables is provided in the Appendix, along with\\ntheir definitions and coding schemes.\\nQuestions and hypotheses\\nThis paper primarily centers on the definition and measurement ofpoverty, with immediate focus on whether the operational definition\\nsupplied is empirically supported. The operational definition used is that\\npoverty is a relative concern, in which economic well-being, capability, and\\nsocial inclusion dimensions indicate the overall state of household well-\\nbeing, with those at the bottom of the distribution of each of thesedimensions being the poorest of the poor. Because the five dimensions\\nincluding economic well-being, capability, and three social inclusion\\ndimensions \\u2014 economic, political, and civic/cultural \\u2014 are unobservable\\nand because existing research is only indicative of potentially appropriate\\nindicators, the study poses the question of which indicators are\\nappropriate to measure each of the poverty dimensions. The measurement\\nof economic well-being can be straightforward, while the measurements of\\nthe capability and three social inclusion dimensions are more complex,\\nthus invoking appropriate empirical guidance.\\nTo test the operational definition provided, the hypothesis presented\\nis that the multidimensionality of poverty holds with statistically significant\\nrelationships among the five poverty dimensions and that the relationships\\namong the dimensions are all positive. This would indicate whether all five\\ndimensions are integral to poverty measurement and whether one\\u2019s high\\nscore on one dimension would minimize its probability of being poor\\noverall. Finally, the study seeks to identify an appropriate method to applythe multidimensional approach, necessitating examination of alternative\\nways the produced dimension scores can be aggregated to identify the\\npoverty status of households.U. Wagle\\n304\\nThe model\\nThe multidimensional model of poverty attempts to test many poverty\\ntheories, based on the conviction that these isolated theories are notmutually exclusive and that integrating them would be highly useful tomore realistically measure poverty. Recognizing economic well-being,\\ncapability, and economic, political, and civic/cultural inclusion as different\\ndimensions of poverty, this model estimates household scores on each ofthese dimensions. Because of the involvement of five latent dimensionsmeasurable using instrumental variables, the model is best suited forestimation in the structural equation modeling framework. Structuralequation modeling is a statistical technique that employs samplecovariance matrix of the observed variables, estimates the populationcovariance matrix as indicated by the specifications provided, andindicates how well the two matrices match (Bollen, 1989). The followingequations apply:\\ng~Bgzf\\ny~Lgze\\nwhere gis the vector containing g\\n1,g2,g3,g4, and g5as the estimates\\nof economic well-being, capability, and economic, political, and civic/\\ncultural inclusion, respectively;4yis the vector of five gvalues; fis the\\nerror in equation; eis the vector of measurement errors; Bis the\\ncoefficient matrix; and Lis the vector of factor loadings. The first,\\nlatent variable equation specifies the causal relationships among thepoverty dimensions whereas the second, the measurement equation,resembling a multivariate regression model, specifies the relationshipsbetween poverty dimensions and their indicators. With the integrationof factor analysis and multivariate regression, this model requiresestimating poverty dimensions using the associated indicators and theirinterrelationships.\\nThe final model presented in Figure 1, while maintaining the basic\\nframework intact, derives after multiple iterations of specification,estimation, and evaluation.\\n5The use of categorical indicators with highly\\nskewed distributions makes the estimation process more complicated,necessitating computation of \\u2018tetrachoric,\\u2019 \\u2018polychoric,\\u2019 and \\u2018polyserial\\u2019correlations. Utilizing these correlations, the weighted least-squaredestimator used here provides precise estimates, thus making it best suitedto handle this complicated estimation environment (Muthen and Muthen,2001).\\nAs presented in Table 1, the overall goodness-of-fit measures\\nproduced by the model lie within a reasonable range. First, while its x\\n2\\nstatistic of 880 with 182 degrees of freedom does not yield a p\\nvalue anywhere close to the ideal probability level of at least 0.05,\\nthe ratio of x2statistic to the degrees of freedom estimated at 4.84\\nlies within the liberal comfort zone of less than five (Bollen, 1989).Multidimensional Poverty Measurement\\n305\\nThis appears to be adequate considering the highly skewed distribution\\nof several indicator variables and the complexity of the model with\\nmultiple latent concepts to be estimated.6Other popular fit measures\\nincluding the root mean squared error approximation, the cumulative fitindex, and the Tucker\\u2013Louis index reported in Table 1 also indicate that\\nthe model demonstrates adequate fit (Bollen, 1989; Garson, 2003).\\nAdditionally, the R2estimates provided in Table 2 suggest that the model is\\ncapable of explaining relatively high degrees of variation in the observed as\\nwell as latent variables. Especially notable are the considerably large R2\\nestimates for almost all poverty dimensions, signifying the strength of the\\nmodel.\\nFIGURE 1. The multidimensional poverty model.U.

Wagle\\n308\\nResults\\nThe indicators of poverty dimensions\\nWhile it is debatable which indicators are best suited to measure the\\npoverty dimensions, I use the model output presented in Table 1 together\\nwith the exploratory factor analysis results7(not reported) to identify the\\nappropriateness of the indicators used. First, the potential indicators of\\neconomic well-being include income, wealth, consumption, and othersubjective views regarding the adequacy of income for food and non-food\\nexpenses, and the effect of increase in income on food and non-food\\nexpenses (Pradhan and Ravallion, 2000; World Bank, 2001, 2003a; UNDP,2002). The model overwhelmingly supports that income, consumption,\\nand adequacy of income for food and for non-food expenses are\\nappropriate indicators of economic well-being. Clear cleavages exist,however, between the objective and subjective notions of poverty (Wagle,\\n2004a). The former is measured through income and consumption, andTable 2.

Results indicate with a highdegree of confidence that householder\\u2019s educational attainment, average\\neducational attainment for adults aged 18 and older, overall nutritional\\nstatus as revealed by householders, and equality of educational opportu-\\nnities among both genders in households can be used as indicators of\\ncapability.\\nThird, the potentially relevant indicators of economic inclusion\\ninclude employment status, occupation, industry of employment, caste\\nand ethnic discrimination in economic activities, and access to financial\\nresources (Khundker et al. , 1994; Atkinson, 1998; Evans, 1998; Moser,\\n1998; Chatterjee, 1999; Castel, 2000). The model suggests that statistically\\nsignificant indicators include being in executive and professional occupa-\\ntion; being in farm, armed forces, labor, or machine operations\\noccupations;8percentage of members employed in unregistered busi-\\nnesses; and access to financial resources.\\nFourth, the theory suggests that political inclusion can be measured\\nemploying citizenship card holding, voter registration, participation in\\npolitical activities, participation in informal policy talks, headship of\\npolitical positions, visits from politicians, and communication withpoliticians (Gore et al. , 1995; de Wit, 1996; Figueroa et al. , 1996;\\nStrobel, 1996; Taylor, 1999; UNDP, 2000a; Burchardt et al. , 2002). The\\nmodel uncovered statistical confidence for five of these indicators.\\nincluding voting frequency, participation in political activities, participa-\\ntion in informal policy talks, visits from political leaders, and communica-tion with political leaders.\\nFifth, the indicators of civic and cultural inclusion may include\\norganizational memberships, participation in social activities, participation\\nin joint activities, family contacts, social networks and ties, access to non-economic help, and availability of friends for children in the neighborhood\\n(Amis and Rakodi, 1994; Gunatilleke and Perera, 1994; Jordan, 1996;\\nWhite, 1997; Castel, 2000; Opel, 2000; Burchardt et al. , 2002; Grootaert,\\n2002). The model supports the fact that average organizational member-\\nships for adults, participation in social activities, participation in jointactivities, and social networks and ties can be used as indicators of civic/\\ncultural inclusion with very high confidence.\\nThe multidimensionality of poverty\\nConsistent with the operational definition used, the existence of a\\nstrong relationship among the five poverty dimensions supports theU. Wagle\\n310\\nmultidimensionality hypothesis, indicating that these dimensions are in\\nfact all embedded in poverty. The model supports that each of the fivedimensions has some causal effects on some or all other povertydimensions (see Table 1 and Fig. 1).\\nTwo sets of statistics are important to address the nature and\\nmagnitude of the relationships among poverty dimensions. First, thecorrelation statistics presented in Table 3 conspicuously suggest that allfive dimensions are highly and positively related. This positive relationshipis consistent with the multidimensional poverty definition, suggesting thata household\\u2019s relatively high score on one dimension reduces its overall\\nprobability of being poor. The considerably large correlation estimates\\ncorroborate that when households are more capable, they tend to havehigher levels of economic well-being as well as more meaningfulparticipation in economic activities. Economic inclusion and economicwell-being, which are related by definition, report a large correlationestimate. Similarly, households that engage more in civic/cultural activitiestend to participate more in political activities. Albeit smaller incomparison, other estimates are also considerably large, manifesting high\\nrelevance of the multidimensional model.\\nSecond, as presented in Table 4, some poverty dimensions confer\\nlarge effects on other dimensions, signifying their influential roles in\\ndetermining the latter. Since the effect of one dimension on another canadopt direct and indirect paths, the testing of effects hypothesis shouldheed total effects. The total standardized effects reported in Table 4 takeinto account the direct and indirect effects, representing the total changein one poverty dimension score due to a unit change in another dimensionscore.\\n9The capability dimension appears to affect all other dimensions,\\nwhereas none affects it. Although capability is relatively highly correlated\\nTable 3.

Consistent with thehuman capital and capability poverty arguments (Becker, 1964; Lucas,1988; Sen, 1992), the total standardized effect of capability on economic\\nwell-being and economic inclusion is almost one, indicating that one\\nstandard deviation change in the former will lead to almost one standarddeviation change each in the latter. One of the most telling stories thismodel suggests is that education, which is at the core of all indicators ofcapability, is also at the epicenter of being able to meaningfully participatein the labor market and the larger economy, and deriving adequateincome and consumption to escape poverty.\\nOvershadowed by these large effects are the relatively smaller effects\\nof capability on political inclusion and civic/cultural inclusion. Again most\\ncrucial is the contribution that education makes to a household\\u2019s\\nparticipation in political as well as civic/cultural activities. While thefinding regarding the primacy of education is self-explanatory, the level ofeducation appears to have been determined independently of any otherpoverty dimension, thus evoking further clarifications. Command overresources and political or civic/cultural ties, for example, do not ensurehigher levels of educational attainment. Partly, this is a precursor for therole of demographic factors in determining one\\u2019s capability necessitating\\nmore complex models (Wagle, 2004b).\\nEconomic well-being is another dimension that substantially affects\\npolitical and civic/cultural inclusion, reaffirming the thesis that one needsa good command over resources to be able to meaningfully participate inpolitical and social activities, which especially in contexts like this providea license to hold political power and social recognition. No doubt, theTable 4.

But some reverse causation might be at work, signifying that thecommand over resources is a prerequisite with its dominant roles indetermining one\\u2019s participation in politics and civil society.\\nTable 4 also records a relatively large effect of civic/cultural inclusion\\non political inclusion. The finding that those participating more in civic,cultural, and associational activities also tend to participate more intenselyin political activities, including partisan activities, political contacts, andpolicy discussions, is consistent with suggestions elsewhere (Almond andVerva, 1963; Krishna, 2002; Putnam, 1993, 2000; Wagle, 2004c). Thosewho stay tuned in their communities also tend to be conscious of politicalissues surrounding them, thus encouraging their fuller participation. But\\nthe model does not detect any reverse causation that political inclusion\\nmight have on civic/cultural inclusion, perhaps indicating a contrastbetween the relatively nascent political culture and the rich social and civicculture this society is historically accustomed to, even after the restorationof multiparty democracy in 1990.\\nPoverty measurement\\nThe use of a comprehensive operational definition suggests thatidentifying poverty status would involve looking at one\\u2019s scores on allpoverty dimensions. The summary statistics provided in Table 5 indicate\\nthat whereas all scores are centered on zero, signifying their normalized\\ncharacteristics, their distributions are different. Large distributions suggestthat household statuses on a particular poverty dimension are highlyunequal whereas smaller ones indicate less inequality. Particularly notice-able is the distribution of capability dimension scores, which are highlyconcentrated, indicating their smaller variance, compared with therelatively large variance of the economic inclusion scores.\\nWhile researchers use absolute, relative, or subjective approaches to\\nestablish poverty standards, the absolute approach dominates the entirefield of poverty research (Citro and Michael, 1995; Haveman, 1987; Wagle,forthcoming). Although the absolute approach is used to identify income\\nTable 5.

Without further ado, I apply 30% and 40% poverty estimates\\nprovided by other studies using income and consumption standards.11\\nDifferent ways exist to aggregate poverty dimension scores, however.\\nFirst, poverty status can be ascertained, based on each of the poverty\\ndimensions separately, with the results aggregated using some highly\\nplausible assumptions. While differential weights could be used, this\\nalternative would be primarily unweighted since poverty status is\\nidentified separately on each of the poverty dimensions. Second, theabsolute scores can be aggregated to derive one single set of overall\\npoverty scores, assuming equal or differential weights. This set of final\\npoverty scores could be used for absolute or relative purposes, with theformer requiring some pre-established criteria to define what value is\\nassociated with particular poverty status,\\n12and the latter (used here)\\ninvoking derivation of more simple, relative thresholds. Although other\\nalternatives also exist,13I focus on these two.\\nUnder the first alternative, the poverty status of households is\\nidentified for each of the five poverty dimensions, using 30% and 40%poverty estimates. Because social inclusion is the aggregate of economic,\\npolitical, and civic/cultural inclusion dimensions, the social inclusion\\npoverty status of households is identified by applying an arbitrary but\\nrealistic assumption that poor households would manifest poverty on at\\nleast two of the three social inclusion dimensions. The three povertydimensions that I refer to, hereinafter, would thus indicate economic well-\\nbeing, capability, and social inclusion dimensions. Given the poor or non-\\npoor status of households, further aggregation would detail the intensityof poverty experienced by households. In effect, households experiencing\\npoverty on all three dimensions are considered \\u2018abject poor\\u2019 as they are\\ndeeply entrenched in poverty, with minimal likelihood of escape.\\n14\\nHouseholds experiencing poverty on two dimensions are considered \\u2018verypoor,\\u2019 as they are at risk of being the abject poor but are slightly betterpositioned. All other households that are poor on only one of the three\\ndimensions are considered \\u2018poor,\\u2019 which are relatively better off with\\nmuch higher chance of escaping poverty.\\nTable 6 indicates that the application of this comprehensive definition\\nalong with 30% and 40% poverty estimates would categorize close to 40%\\nand 50% of the households as the poor in general. About 10% of the\\nhouseholds would fall into the categories of poor and very poor each,\\nwhereas close to 20% and 30% would fall in the category of abject poor.\\nThe difference between using 30% and 40% estimates would be chiefly onhaving the size of the abject poor 10 percentage points apart, with the\\nproportion of the very poor and poor remaining unchanged. Similarly,\\nTable 6 suggests that the economic well-being and capability poor tend toU. Wagle\\n314\\nTable 6.

With the motivation of analyzing\\nsensitivity with respect to outcomes, I apply various weighting schemes, all\\nusing the 40% poverty estimate.15The process involved combining the\\neconomic, political, and civic/cultural inclusion dimension scores into one\\nset of social inclusion scores and then applying different weighting\\nschemes to aggregate the scores into the final set of overall poverty scores.\\nLargely consistent with the outcomes presented in Table 6 using the 30%\\nestimate, poverty rates of 10%, 10%, and 20% were used to categorize thepoor, very poor, and abject poor.\\nThe resulting, highly symmetric poverty categorization outcomes\\nindicate that the outcomes are most conforming between using 75%weights on the capability and economic well-being dimensions. Using\\nequal weight does not appear to provide much different poverty\\ncategorization outcomes either. Assigning the highest weight to the social\\ninclusion dimension, however, provides highly contrasting poverty\\nmeasurement outcomes. Whereas 60% of the households were non-poor\\nin each individual scenario, only 36%, 31%, and 32% of the households\\nwould be consistently categorized as non-poor, as suggested by the use of\\nhigh weight on social inclusion dimension, and the use of equal weight\\nand high weights on capability and economic well-being dimensions.\\nDiscussions and conclusion\\nEstimation of the multidimensional model of poverty suggests severalimportant findings. The finding that select indicators are appropriate tomeasure poverty dimensions insinuates that policy-makers refocus on each\\nof the thematic policy areas differently. First, although consumption itself\\nand subjective views on the adequacy of income are important, one can\\neasily deduce from the leading role of income in this highly urbanized\\nsetting that the major policy concern to improve economic well-being\\nshould be on increasing household income. Paid employment being the\\nmajor source of income in Kathmandu, especially for the economically less\\nwell-off households,\\n16the highly inadequate wages these households\\nreceive require serious attention.17Second, consistent with the realization\\nby the World Bank (2003b), the UNDP (2002), and others, providing\\neducational opportunities especially for women and providing health care\\nfacilities appear to be more fundamental at enhancing capability. The role\\nof education, however, can be the most central of all in a society in which alack of education is clearly linked to one\\u2019s inability to maintain good\\nhealth together with practices that undermine the economic and other\\npotentials of daughters.U.

In a society where there are stark social and\\neconomic discrepancies between skilled and unskilled jobs, and where\\nnew entrepreneurs lack the needed financial support, appropriate policyinitiatives can make a difference. Fourth, although electoral and other\\nforms of political participation in Nepal dramatically increased in the early\\n1990s, thanks to the restoration of multiparty democracy that energized\\npeople to participate, it effectively waned away by the end of the 1990s\\n(Wagle, 2004c).\\n18In Nepal, with a nascent political culture and a long\\nhistory of authoritarian regime, policies targeted at strengthening political\\ninclusion should focus on measures to increase electoral participation,\\nraise citizen awareness of the political process and policy issues, and\\nfacilitate communication between voters and political leaders. Moreover,\\nalthough Kathmandu has a rich heritage of holding civic and culturalactivities, its increasingly urban setting with a large migrant population\\nposes a serious challenge for policy-makers seeking to promote inclusion\\nof isolated groups and communities. Findings suggest that expanding the\\ncivil society sector with increased citizen participation in both registered\\nand unregistered organizations or groups and with increased emphasis onself-help activities can be the focus of policies aimed at promoting civic/\\ncultural inclusion.\\nNext, the model conspicuously supported the multidimensionality\\nhypothesis, suggesting that the theoretically supported dimensions ofpoverty are in fact all related, with the ability to reveal more realistically the\\noverall poverty status of households. Economic well-being, the focus of\\nmost contemporary analyses, constitutes only one of several dimensions of\\npoverty, and, albeit important, does not provide a realistic picture.\\nFurthermore, income and consumption that are at the core of avoidinghunger, malnutrition, and deprivation do not necessarily predict the\\noutcomes in terms of the overall living conditions and state of human well-\\nbeing. This analysis strongly supports that economic well-being helps\\ntransform capability into other activities indicative of living conditions,\\nincluding political and civic/cultural inclusion. What is more fundamentalfrom the social policy perspective is the capability that overwhelmingly\\ncontributes to acquiring economic well-being, obviously because educa-\\ntion can be a prerequisite to having adequate income or consumption.More educated or more informed people, for example, are less likely to be\\npoor not only because they are better prepared for employment, but also\\nbecause they make more informed decisions in acquiring or managing\\nresources as well as making other life decisions. Consistent with the\\ncapability arguments (Sen, 1992, 1999; UNDP, 2000a,b; Sparkes andGlennerster, 2002; World Bank, 2003b; Wagle, 2004b), the overall\\ncapability of a household is a strong predictor of all other dimensions of\\npoverty.U. Wagle\\n318\\nThe model further insinuates that economic and political inclusions\\nare result dimensions, and do not affect other dimensions. Contrary to\\nwhat one would normally expect, participation in the labor market, accessto financial resources such as bank credit, and involvement in different\\neconomic activities do not predict one\\u2019s real gain from the economy,\\nwhether it is in the form of capability or economic well-being. The sameholds true for political participation. While political participation or being\\nincluded in political circles and networks is thought to be important,\\nespecially in economies where the public sector predominates and the\\nshare of the private sector is minimal, the overall capability, command over\\nresources, and the level of integration in the community and larger civilsociety collectively determine a household\\u2019s extent of political inclusion.\\nPolitical participation necessitates rational actions regarding what is\\nbeneficial and what is not, which can be costly in today\\u2019s modern world.\\nLacking knowledge about public affairs in a particular locality or nation,\\nhouseholds may not know the process and the outcomes of politicalparticipation. This may be more the case in a society in which politics is a\\ngame largely dominated by those in power, with very little competition\\nfrom outsiders (Bista, 1991). It is a form of exclusion in which a small\\nminority with information and power can manipulate the vulnerable\\nmajority, effectively denying them the basic rights including rights togovern themselves. Although integration in the civil society and culture\\nhas a generally positive impact on poverty status of households, this\\nanalysis does not detect its direct role in improving the economic well-being conditions, as is sometimes argued (Grootaert, 2002).\\nSince this model predicts household scores on all five dimensions, it\\nprovides more comprehensive information that is useful to predict the\\noverall poverty status of households. Undoubtedly, those at the bottom\\nend of the distribution of different poverty dimension scores will be the\\npoorest of the poor. But who can be categorized as poor and who as non-poor is a political issue, since generally the government policy may\\neffectively reduce or increase the proportion of population living in\\npoverty. Although the scores presented capture the absolute status of\\nhouseholds on each of the poverty dimensions, their highly objective\\nnature makes their absolute use more complicated, thus invoking thenecessity to focus on their relative use instead. Concluding that a\\nhousehold is situated at the top, middle, or bottom levels of the\\ndistribution, for example, conveys a more specific message than simplyproviding 20.023 or 0.23 as an absolute dimension score. This\\ncomparative perspective, if appropriately used, can be valuable to\\nascertain whether a household is poor or not, provided that there is a\\ncommon understanding on the specific poverty threshold. Income or\\nconsumption poverty thresholds convey simple and easily understandableconnotations due to their monetary measurement (Citro and Michael,\\n1995; Wagle, 2002, forthcoming). What fails to be recognized, however, is\\nthe arbitrary and political nature of these poverty standards. The widelyMultidimensional Poverty Measurement\\n319\\nused international poverty standard with a threshold of one-dollar-a-day\\nincome, for example, makes an implicit assumption for a \\u2018wise\\u2019 use of\\nincome \\u2014 otherwise its appeals would fail. Similarly, the consumptionpoverty standards, set at certain calories of food that assume a proper\\ncombination of different nutritional ingredients, can easily be contested or\\nviolated. Often, policy-makers weigh in the consequences of having ahigher or a lower threshold of poverty, using sensitivity analyses, so that\\nestablishing appropriate and politically amenable poverty standards\\ncounts as common policy framework, such as health care, education,\\nand crime fighting.\\nUntil some widely agreed-upon estimate of poverty, or a criterion to\\ndemarcate the poor from the rest, is identified on each of thepoverty dimensions, analysts can draw from poverty estimates provided\\nby others. The use of 30% and 40% poverty estimates in Kathmandu was\\nan example of this. The finding based on these estimates that 20% and30% would be the poorest of the poor is very useful, especially from a\\npolicy standpoint, since the identification of the abject poor would\\nhelp policy-makers to better target welfare or other development aid.\\nIdentification of the very poor households making up almost 10% in\\nboth cases is another valuable policy contribution, suggesting that thisgroup should be the next priority of the government. Irrespective of the\\npoverty estimates used, the usefulness of the multidimensional approach\\nlies in its ability to provide information on the relative poverty status of\\nhouseholds in which those at the bottom are the poorest, needing the\\nmost extensive array of public and policy resources. This is more the casein societies like Nepal, and more specifically Kathmandu, where the\\ngovernment faces the recurrent challenge to better allocate extremely\\nscarce resources.\\nAssigning appropriate weight is important because using weighted\\nscores yields considerably different measurement outcomes, especially\\nwhen the social inclusion dimension was weighted the highest. Weighting\\nsocial inclusion more heavily resulted in outcomes that were highly\\nunpredictable, compared with using economic well-being and capability\\ndimension scores. Not every dimension is equally important. How muchweight each deserves depends on the particular society under considera-\\ntion. More urbanized and/or monetized societies, for example, would put\\nmore weight on economic well-being, which would be different from\\nmore communitarian \\u2014 perhaps including rural \\u2014 societies that may put\\nmore weight on social solidarity and cohesiveness. This makes a strongcase that assigning proper weight to each of the poverty dimensions is\\nimmensely crucial to realistically identifying the poverty status of house-\\nholds. While this might serve as another policy arena letting governments\\npoliticize the issue of poverty measurement, social preferences indicating\\nthe value of each poverty dimension should be an integral part of povertyanalysis, since which weighting scheme is more appropriate largely\\ndepends on the particular value system that a society upholds. Thus, futureU. Wagle\\n320\\nresearch should focus on identifying a weighting scheme that is consistent\\nwith the value system in a given society and culture. Social scienceresearch can offer much on this by applying survey methodologies thatattempt to elicit people\\u2019s true preferences.\\nAnother issue for future research relates to the indicators of poverty\\ndimensions. Data on more exhaustive list of indicators should be collected\\nand processed to develop more robust models. Also needed are large and\\npreferably cross-national studies to derive findings that may be generalizedfor a wider application of this multidimensional approach.\\nNotes\\n1 Attempts to incorporate multiple dimensions of poverty have historically been inspired\\nby Adelman and Morris\\u2019s (1967, 1973) work that sought to quantify the extent ofeconomic development using a number of indicators and to identify social, cultural,political, and other policy variables that influence it. Their focus, however, was on\\nmacro indicators that helped to identify the state of economic development in a\\nnumber of developing countries.\\n2 A recent national living standard survey, for example, concludes that the incidence of\\npoverty in the country has declined from 42% in 1996 to 30% in 2002 ( Kathmandu\\nPost, 2004a). While the poverty standard estimated at consumption of 2124 food\\ncalories per day has remained unchanged, the revised poverty estimate has beenreported citing an overwhelming increase in foreign remittance ( Kathmandu Post ,\\n2004b). The question is whether this increase in income automatically enables people\\nto secure the established consumption standards.\\n3 Out of these households, however, only 610 had complete data, thus making an\\neffective sample size of 610.\\n4 While there are five dimensions of poverty represented by the gvalues, the actual\\noperationalization used here includes two other latent concepts, including objectiveand subjective economic well-being, which together form the economic well-beingdimension. Accommodating these changes, the model embodies seven gvalues,\\nsuggesting that the first part of the model includes seven equations. In this case, there\\nwill be seven elements of the gvector throughout. This can be easily verified in the final\\nmodel presented in Figure 1 later.\\n5 This final model is identified using the t- and two-step rules (Bollen, 1989). While I\\ncould manually establish identification using these rules, the use of standard software\\nautomatically does so in an attempt to estimate structural equation modeling modelsand reports any identification problem. The MPlus software used here indicated that\\nthe final version of the model was in fact identified.\\n6 The addition of two latent concepts forming the economic well-being dimension adds\\nan additional layer to the model, thus increasing the number of parameters to beestimated and contributing to its complexity.\\n7 The exploratory factor analysis helps i dentify principal co mponents based on\\ntheir factor loadings on the hypothesized latent factor. This is an additional toolapplied herein to test whether the appropriateness of the indicators suggested bythe literature really holds with a single factor analysis model estimated for each\\ndimension.\\n8 Albeit seemingly arbitrary, these four occupational categories have much in common\\nwith regard to their economic incentives and social recognition. Households withhouseholders in these occupations tend to make substantially lower incomes \\u2014 on\\naverage NRS32 000 annual per capita compared with NRS57000 for all other\\nhouseholds. While armed forces and especially labor occupations have much lowerpayoffs \\u2014 on average associated households having annual per-capita income ofMultidimensional Poverty Measurement\\n321\\nNRS28000 and NRS14000 respectively \\u2014 households associated with all four\\noccupations included in this combined category had annual per-capita income of lessthan NRS50000. These occupations also indicate low-prestige jobs in this urban center,where, unlike in much of the country, people are engaged in a wide variety of\\noccupations. Conversely, the executive and professional occupation, another category\\nincluded in the analysis, carries considerably higher prestige and higher economicpayoff \\u2014 on average the associated households have an annual per-capita income ofNRS60000 compared with NRS50000 for all other households.\\n9 More formally, it is the change in g\\niassociated with a unit shock to gj, which can be\\ncomputed using [ I\\u2013B]21where Iis the identity matrix and Bis the matrix of\\ncoefficients loading on g1,g2,g3,g4, and g5. This expression derives directly from\\ng5Bg+z.\\n10 Assumed for illustrative purposes, this is not to imply that the inequality of capability\\nand social inclusion will be identical to that of economic well-being. Societies may bemore or less economically, capabilistically, or social inclusively equal compared with\\npoverty dimensions other than the one under consideration. Again, this begs a difficult\\nquestion of how to define poverty using each of the dimensions, which, albeit partlyindicated by the distribution of dimension scores, is linked with the absolute versusrelative concepts of poverty.\\n11 The national poverty rate suggested by the Central Bureau of Statistics (1997) using the\\nconsumption-income poverty standard was slightly over 40% in 1996, the revised\\nestimate for which was 30% in 2003 ( Kathmandu Post , 2004a). While other studies\\n(Wagle, forthcoming) have suggested different estimates using income, consumption,and relative poverty standards, using 30% and 40% estimates provide two reasonablealternatives for Kathmandu, given its relatively high poverty rates on economic well-being as well as other dimensions.\\n12 This alternative would necessitate extensive work to ascertain the contribution of each\\nof the poverty dimensions, and therefore their indicators to categorize one as poor or\\nnon-poor. It would also involve tremendous value judgments to decide how particularvalues for particular indicators could be compensatory for others, leaving thelikelihood of the household of being poor unchanged.\\n13 One alternative, for example, is to use scores on all five dimensions to ascertain\\nseparate poverty status of households with some more elaborate assumptions. Another\\nwould be using mean or median scores to identify household poverty status on each ofthe dimensions.\\n14 This might be closer to the concept of chronic poverty defined as being consistently\\npoor for more than five years, which is in vogue among some poverty researchers(Hulme et al. , 2001; Hulme and Shepherd, 2003; Metha and Shah, 2003). Although the\\nfocus of these researchers is basically on the time dimension, the concept of abject\\npoverty goes beyond \\u2014 incorporating its multiple dimensions.\\n15 This is shown for illustrative purposes only. The same can be computed using the 30%\\npoverty estimate.\\n16 The survey data show, for example, that 82% of the income for households with 50% of\\nthe median income, in which at least one member is employed in unregistered\\nbusinesses, derives from wages. This is substantially higher compared with 51% of theincome for households with income above 50% of the median and 34% for allhouseholds.\\n17 The prevailing minimum wage for unskilled workers was NRS1450 (or US$20) per\\nmonth, which was far below the international poverty line. Even this minimum wage is\\nnot strictly adhered to in the unorganized, informal sector in which people from these\\nlow-income households are engaged.\\n18 There are widely held arguments that this political apathy has resulted from large\\ninefficiencies of the democratically elected governments to meet the mass expectationfor long-awaited social and economic reform in the country (Hachhethu, 2004; Pfaff-Czarnecka, 2004; Wagle, 2005).U.

However, it is yet to be understood how the associations between different dimensions of poverty and youth mental health differ across countries. We examine the relationship between multidimensional, as well as income poverty, and depressive symptoms in young people (age 11\\u201325 years) across three middle-\\n income countries.\\n Based on harmonised \\ndata from surveys in Colombia, Mexico and South Africa (N=16 173) we constructed a multidimensional poverty index that comprised five deprivations. We used Poisson regression to examine relationships between different forms of poverty with depressive symptoms across the countries. Multidimensional poverty was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset (IRR (incidence rate ratio)=1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.42), in Mexico (IRR=1.34, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64) and Colombia (IRR=2.01, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.10) but not in South Africa, a finding driven by a lack of associations between child labour and health insurance coverage with depressive symptoms. There was only an association with income poverty and depressive symptoms in South Africa, not in Colombia or Mexico. Depressive symptoms were associated with individual deprivations such as school lag, child labour and lack of access to health services in the harmonised dataset, but not with household deprivations, such as parental unemployment and housing conditions, though the opposite pattern was observed in South Africa. Our findings suggest that the importance of specific dimensions of poverty for mental health varies across countries, and a multidimensional approach is needed to gain insights into the relationship between youth depression and poverty.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPoverty is associated with poorer mental health outcomes,\\n1\\u20133 which in turn can reduce the future Key questions\\nWhat is already known?\\n \\u25baPoverty increases vulnerability to mental health \\nproblems in young people in upper-\\n middle-\\n income \\ncountries (UMICs).\\n \\u25baMost studies have measured poverty focusing on monetary deprivations at the household/parental level with very few studies measuring poverty at the level of the individual young person.\\n \\u25baPoverty is multidimensional, though no studies have compared the relationship between depressive symptoms and multidimensional poverty in young people across countries.\\nWhat are the new findings?\\n \\u25baThe relationship between poverty and depressive symptoms among young people differs across di-mensions of poverty and between countries.\\n \\u25baThe higher the multidimensional poverty, the more prevalent the depressive symptoms in Colombia and Mexico, but not South Africa.\\n \\u25baDepressive symptoms were associated with individ-ual deprivations, such as education, but not house-hold deprivations, such as parental unemployment.\\n \\u25baAn opposite pattern was observed for South Africa.\\nWhat do the new findings imply?\\n \\u25baOur results suggest the importance of different deprivations across countries.\\n \\u25baFurther longitudinal analysis and intervention using a nuanced approach that consider the specific poverty dimensions relevant for each country is critical to improve the mental health of young people in UMICs.\\n \\u25baThese results have important implications for policy as they show that potential targets for interventions targeting poverty and mental illness cycles need to be informed by locally valid deprivation measures with clear associations with mental health. on September 13, 2023 by guest.

Some studies define poverty as consumption of goods and services, which is arguably a more material measure of poverty.\\n2 \\nIn addition, the evidence for an association between mental health and monetary measures of poverty such as income and consumption is fairly inconsistent, with systematic reviews demonstrating that these relationships are dependent on context (such as levels of income and inequality).\\n8 9\\nMultidimensional measures of poverty, conceptu-\\nalise poverty as a spectrum of deprivations encompassing various dimensions of well-\\n being.9\\u201312 To the best of our \\nknowledge, no studies have so far adopted a multidimen-sional approach to understand the relationship between poverty and mental health in young people in low/middle-\\n income countries (LMICs).\\nThere are two key reasons why a multidimensional \\napproach is important to understand the link between poverty and depressive symptoms. First, this relationship may differ depending on whether poverty is measured at the household (eg, household income poverty) or individual level (eg, lack of access to education). Most studies have measured poverty focusing on deprivations at \\nthe household/parental level with very few studies \\nmeasuring poverty at the level of the individual young person. Second, most studies have focused on monetary dimensions of poverty,\\n13\\u201315 but non-  material dimensions \\nof poverty might each have their own complex relation-ship with depressive symptoms. For example, education deprivations may have a bi-\\n directional association with \\ndepression, by which poor education worsens depres\\n-\\nsion outcomes, while depression in turn reduces school performance and increases drop out.\\n16 Deprivations in \\naccess to health services and healthcare insurance may prevent young people from receiving adequate preven-tion and treatment for depressive symptoms.\\n17 Housing \\ndeprivations may impose stress and reduce stability, thereby increasing depressive symptoms.\\n18 Other depri-\\nvations related to the wider household, such as parental unemployment or income, have also been shown to increase childhood depressive symptoms through finan-cial stress, damages to familial relationships and poor parental support.\\n19 Psychosocial aspects of poverty may \\nalso increase depressive symptoms in young people,20 21 \\nfor example, by influencing the opportunities to achieve aspirations, which may lead to low self-\\n esteem and psycho\\n-\\nlogical distress.22 23\\nFurthermore, there may be cross-  countr y differences \\nin how different dimensions of poverty relate to mental health. The relationship between multidimensional poverty and youth depressive symptoms is not necessarily the same in all countries, and it is important to under -\\nstand which dimensions are more salient in different countries. This paper aims to examine these relation-ships across three countries\\u2014South Africa, Mexico and Colombia to explore how the association between multi-dimensional poverty and depressive symptoms in young people may differ between countries. While these coun-tries share similarities, such as rapid economic growth and growing levels of income inequality, they are also distinct in their cultural, social and economic contexts. For instance, South Africa has high levels of unemploy-ment and lower levels of earnings,\\n24 relative to the other \\ncountries. We hypothesise that these contextual differ -\\nences result in a different relationship between mental health and specific dimensions of poverty.\\nWe make a novel contribution to the literature by \\nassessing the relationship between depressive symptoms and multidimensional poverty in young people and comparing these relationships across different countries. Based on the multidimensional poverty index (MPI), which comprises deprivations in health, income, educa-tion and standard of living indicators,\\n25 we aim to capture \\nhow different dimensions of poverty relate to depression in young people. One paper has used an MPI to examine this relationship Li et al,\\n26 but they did not report on \\nhow specific deprivations relate to depression in young people.\\nIn an earlier paper (Diaz et al, under review), we used \\ndata from Colombia to examine the nature of the rela-tionship between multidimensional paper and mental health in Colombia. We found that poverty deprivations associated with human capital are associated with mental health, while there are less associations material depri-vation. Yet, these findings may be specific to Colombia, a country with a unique history of income inequality, armed conflict and internal displacement that may render associations between different dimensions of poverty and mental health different from those in other countries. Using standardised data, the current paper aims to extend this analysis to assess this relationship in Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, three countries with very different socioeconomic, political and histor -\\nical contexts. Both papers are the output of a common collaborative project funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council, the CHANCES-\\n 6 project, \\nwhose aim is to understand the impact and mechanisms linking poverty and mental health in six LMICs. Further details of the CHANCES-\\n 6 project are available in our \\nprotocol paper published in Social Psychiatr\\ny and Psychi-\\natric Epidemiology volume (https://link.springer.com/\\n \\narticle/10.1007/s00127-021-02043-7).\\nThis study focuses on depressive symptoms as depres\\n-\\nsion is the most common mental health disorders among adolescents globally\\n27 and, while depression has been \\nshown to be associated with poverty,2 3 28 no studies have \\nexplored how this relationship differs across dimensions  on September 13, 2023 by guest.

Furthermore, this \\nis the outcome that is most commonly measured in a consistent way across the different countries. We hypoth-esise that deprivations that depressive symptoms may be associated with deprivations that relate directly to young people\\u2019s aspirations or psychological sense of self, such as education or child labour, rather than deprivations defined at the household level.\\nMETHODS\\nDataData came from three nationally representative datasets for each country: the Colombian data were from the 2015 National Mental Health Survey (2015 CMHS), a nationally representative, probabilistic survey.\\n29 The survey involved \\nin-\\n depth questionnaires separated by age groups, adoles\\n-\\ncents from 12 to 17 years old and adults aged 18+ years old. There were 3607 participants between the ages of 11\\u201325 years with complete data required for this study. The Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) is a longitu-dinal, nationally and regionally representative survey, including urban and rural areas. The sample included 8400 households in 150 communities across Mexico, collected over a 10-\\n year period in three rounds from \\n2002, 2005\\u20132006 and 2009\\u20132012. This study took data from the latest wave 3 (2009\\u20132012) and involved separate questionnaires for children under 15 years, and those 15 years and above. There were 7405 participants between the ages of 11 and 25 years with data required for this study\\n. The South African data came from the nationally \\nrepresentative National Income Dynamics Study, a 5-\\n wave \\nlongitudinal sur\\nvey from 2008 to 2017 which aims to \\nprovide representative socioeconomic, behavioural and anthropometric data. This longitudinal study originally recruited a sample of over 28 000 individuals.\\n30 We used \\ndata from the fifth wave collected in 2017 from partic-ipants aged 15\\u201324 years, which comprised 5161 partici-pants between the ages of 15 and 25 years.\\nMeasures of multidimensional poverty\\nWe adapted the Colombian Multidimensional Poverty Index (CMPI) developed by Angulo et al\\n31 and based \\non Alkire and Santos25 approach, to the three countries \\nunder study. The CMPI consists of 15 poverty indica-tors which capture five dimensions of poverty: house-hold education conditions; individual childhood and youth education conditions; labour; health and access to public utilities; and housing conditions. We did not include measures of childcare due to lack of data. The CMPI was chosen for two reasons: (a) while it is based on the Global MPI, it is adjusted in certain ways which are more relevant for upper-\\n middle-\\n income countries \\n(UMICs), \\nrather than low or lower-\\n middle-\\n income \\ncoun-\\ntries, and the collected indicators reflect this; and (b) the volume of missing measures of deprivations in the Global MPI in each country would have made harmonisation impossible, whereas there are substantially fewer missing measures for the\\n31 CMPI across all countries.\\nFollowing the previously reported methodology,25 31 the \\nCMPI is based on fourteen different indicators (measured dichotomously and referring to specific poverty-\\n related \\ndeprivations of the five broader dimensions: education, childhood conditions, employment, health and access to public ser\\nvices). The specific deprivations are listed \\nin online supplemental table 1. To calculate the CMPI, the 14 specific indicators are added using a nested weighting system, where the five broader dimensions have equal weight. As there are a different number of indicators within each dimension, indicators in different dimensions do not necessarily have the same weights: (a) household education conditions (two indicators), (b) childhood and adolescent conditions (four indicators), (c) labour market participation (two indicators), (d) health (two indicators) and (e) access to public utilities and housing conditions (five indicators). The resulting score is termed the C-\\n weighted sum of deprivations and \\ncan take values from 0 to 1, where 0 reflects no depri\\n-\\nvation, and 1 reflects deprivation across all indicators. (See online supplemental table 1 for details of dimen-sions, indicators and weightings for the CMPI.) We used the continuous CMPI scores, and, for sensitivity analysis, we also calculated the \\u2018deprivation cut-\\n off\\n\\u2019, following \\nprevious studies25 in which the threshold for multidimen-\\nsional poverty is if the C-\\n weighted sum of deprivations is \\nequal or \\nlarger than the 0.33 threshold.31 We classified \\nindividuals living in households with a C-\\n weighted \\nsum \\nof deprivations larger or equal to 0.33 as being in \\u2018multi-dimensional poverty\\u2019. In other words, this approach clas-sifies households as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in 33% or more dimensions overall. For multi-dimensional poverty, we used the continuous measure to avoid comparing large groups of people very close to the threshold. For the individual indicators, we used a dichotomy, distinguishing whether an individual was deprived in a specific dimension or not. We examine the relationship between both the overall multidimensional poverty and each of the dimensions separately. Online supplemental table 1 shows distributions of weighted multidimensional poverty scores of each country.\\n31\\nIncome measure of povertyA traditional measure of poverty, income, was also investi-gated. In South Africa, participants were asked to provide their monthly household income. In Colombia, partici-pants were asked to provide their yearly wage and in Mexico participants were asked for their last 12 months of income. We then converted household income into country-\\n specific quartiles, and classified individuals in \\nthe lowest quartile of income in each countr\\ny as income \\npoor.32 33\\nDepressive symptomsThe primary outcome is self-\\n reported depressive symp\\n-\\ntoms (continuous), and the secondary outcome is risk for  on September 13, 2023 by guest.

T\\notal scores range from 0 to 20, with higher \\nscores indicating a greater likelihood that the individual is depressed.

The continuous score is used as a primary outcome, rather than the binary outcome. This screening tool was developed by the WHO and it has been widely used and validated in LMICs; in addition, the SRQ-\\n \\n20 cut-\\n \\noff\\n \\u2265\\n4 has been previously validated in \\nColombia.29\\nThe South African dataset used the 10-  item Centre for \\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-\\n D-\\n 1035). \\nThis is a 4-\\n point Likert questionnaire in which participants \\nanswer from 0 to 3 (Rarely\\n, Some of the Time, Occasion-\\nally, All the Time) to questions of symptoms, including depressed mood, restless sleep, decreased energy and enjoyment in life, as well as feelings of loneliness and sadness. Scores range from 0 to 30, with greater scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. When validated against the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview as the gold standard comparison in a representative South African population,\\n36 a cut-  off of 12 on the CES-  D-  10 presented \\nthe \\nmost balanced sensitivity (71.4%) and specificity \\n(72.6%) for a probable diagnosis of major depression. Symptoms of depression were summed and categorised into either low (CES\\u2010D<12) or elevated (CES\\u2010D\\u226512) symptomatology groups.\\nThe MxFLS measured emotional well-\\n being using \\nthe Clinical Questionnaire for the Diagnosis of Depres\\n-\\nsive Syndrome (Cuestionario Clinico para el Diagnostico del Sindrome Depresivo (CCDSD)). Across 21 items about emotional well-\\n being, participants were asked \\u2018in the \\nlast four weeks, have you experienced X symptoms\\u2019 and asked to respond either \\u2018No, Sometimes, Many times or All the time\\u2019. \\nThe answers are worth 1\\u20134 points, respec-\\ntively, depending on the frequency of the symptoms experienced (from 1 point for No to 4 points for All the time). The total psychometric score is the sum of the individual scores from all questions. As such, the CCDSD scale ranges from 20 to 84, 20 being the minimal level of depressive symptoms, and 84 the maximum level of depressive symptoms. We used previously established cut-\\n \\noff points,37 where a score over 65 reflects clinically \\nsignificant depression. Though the CCDSD cut-\\n off \\nhas \\nnot been compared to a gold standard, the measure is shown to be highly reliable, Cronbach \\u03b1=0.85.\\n37\\nTo facilitate comparisons across measures, we \\nnormalised continuous scores for each of the three scales. We scaled depressive symptom scores to values between 0 and 1, using the following formula:\\n zi=xi\\u2212min(\\nx)\\nmax(\\nx)\\n\\u2212min(\\nx)  Where zi is normalised scores,  xi  is the individual\\u2019 s \\ndepressive symptom score and  min(x)   and  max(x)   are \\nthe \\nminimum and maximum depressive symptom scores \\nfor the country-\\n specific measure.\\nData analysis\\nData \\nwere analysed using Stata V.16 (Stata Corp) and used \\ncalibrated post-\\n stratification sampling weights to adjust \\nfor disproportionate representation of sample sizes, rela\\n-\\ntive to the population size of each country. Our results are based on a complete-\\n case analysis of 16 173 partici\\n-\\npants, whereby participants with missing values on any question on multidimensional poverty were excluded. In total, there were 1538 participants excluded for missing data on multidimensional poverty.\\nFirst, we assessed descriptive data of the young people \\nfrom each country and the harmonised dataset. Due to positive skewness of the normalised depression scores (see histogram in online supplemental figure 1) Poisson regression analyses were used throughout, and coeffi-cients were converted into incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Second, we assessed the association between depressive symptoms and multidimensional poverty in the harmon-ised dataset, using Poisson regression analyses with normalised, continuous depressive symptoms scores as the dependent variable and multidimensional poverty (continuous) as the independent variable in participants aged 11\\u201325 years. Age, sex and country were entered as potential covariates. Third, in a separate analysis, we also assessed the interaction between multidimensional poverty and sex in the harmonised dataset. We also tested whether there were significant differences across coun-tries by running a Wald test to compare the fit of the model with and without an interaction with the country. We also repeated the Poisson regressions for each indi-vidual country.\\nForth, we implemented regression models using indi-\\nvidual poverty indicators (dichotomous) to assess how different dimensions of poverty relate to depressive symp-toms. All indicators were entered simultaneously into one model: education attendance, child labour, school lag, young persons\\u2019 lack of health insurance or healthcare and deprivations related to the household (adequate floors, adequate walls, access to sewage clearance, access to water, overcrowding). There was low-\\n moderate \\ncollin-\\nearity in the model (Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)=1.89) suggesting multicollinearity is not likely to be a problem in the regression model. Finally, we repeated the analysis with income as the measure of poverty to assess the rela-tionship between depressive symptoms and a traditional measure of poverty.\\nSensitivity analyses\\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to explore whether including depression as a categorical (yes/no) variable impacted the results by classifying individuals into binary depression risk based on the respective binary cut-\\n offs for \\neach scale, as detailed above.

In addition, we adapted the CMPI to the South African dataset by excluding indi-cators that were less appropriate for the South African context, namely access to health insurance and child labour. The question on child labour was only asked to a subset of individuals who reported not attending school, thus the prevalence of child labour was likely underesti-mated in South Africa. Similarly, while free public health-care in South Africa is accessible, private healthcare is a marker of privilege for those with higher socioeconomic status.

The overall lower prevalence rates in Colombia may be explained by these lower rates of unemployment and housing and access to healthcare.\\nRelationship between po\\nverty and depressive symptoms\\nIn multivariate regression models, there was evidence \\nfor a positive and significant association between multi-dimensional poverty and the severity of depressive symp-toms (IRR=1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.42; table\\n \\n2). Individuals who lived in a household classified as multidimensionally poor had a significantly 25% higher rate ratio of depres-sive symptoms compared with those not poor.

We ran a Wald test to compare the fit of the model with and without the interaction with country and showed whether the association between MPI and depressive symptoms differed by country. We then explored these interactions using Poisson regres-sion (see online supplemental table 3), which shows that the relationship between poverty and depressive symp-toms is inverted for South Africa compared with Mexico (IRR=0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85), and a slightly weaker association in Colombia (IRR=1.46 0.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34), which suggests no difference in the relation-ship between poverty and depressive symptoms between Mexico and Colombia.\\nTable 2  Poisson r egression of multidimensional poverty (dichotomous) on depressive symptoms of participants aged 11\\u201325 \\nyears from the harmonised dataset, as well as individual datasets from Mexico, South Africa and Colombia\\nHarmonised (n=16 173) South Africa (n=5161) Mexico (n=7405) Colombia (n=3607)\\nIRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)\\nMultidimensional poverty (ref.: no poverty)1.25(1.10 to 1.42)0.94(0.83 to 1.07)1.35(1.11 to 1.64)2.01(1.30 to 3.10)\\nSex (ref.: male) 1.37(1.32 to 1.42)1.04(1.00 to 1.08)1.55(1.47 to 1.64)1.49(1.32 to 1.68)\\nAge 1.00(0.10 to 1.01)1.02(1.01 to 1.03)0.99(0.98 to 1.00)1.49(1.32 to 1.68)\\nSouth Africa (ref.: Mexico) 1.02\\n(0.99 to 1.05)\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nColombia (ref.: Mexico) 0.39\\n(0.36 to 0.41)\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nIRR, incidence rate ratio. on September 13, 2023 by guest.

The positive relationship between multi\\n-\\ndimensional poverty and binary depression remained significant (OR=1.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.48; see online supplemental table 4), and the same country specific trends hold, that is, there was a positive relationship for Colombia and Mexico, but not South Africa. Findings also remain the same when a dichotomous multidimen-sional poverty measure is used (online supplemental table 5). There was a positive relationship between multi-dimensional poverty and depressive symptoms in both adolescents (11\\u201318 years; IRR=1.36, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.67) and young adults (19\\u201325 years; IRR=1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.41; see online supplemental table 5). In further sensitivity analyses, we adapted the MPI to the South African dataset by excluding dimensions that were not appropriately measured for the South African dataset: access to health insurance and child labour. The rela-tionship between depressive symptoms and multidimen-sional poverty remained significant in the harmonised dataset (IRR=1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.47). In South Africa, the relationship became significant (IRR=1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30), when less relevant poverty indicators were removed the association became significant.\\nSpecific dimensions of poverty and depressive symptoms\\nResults from the Poisson regression model of separate multidimensional poverty indicators on depressive symp-toms are displayed in table\\n \\n4. See figure\\n \\n1 for a visual \\ndepiction of the model. The first set of indicators of poverty captured dimensions at the individual level. In the harmonised dataset, child labour and school lag had positive associations with depressive symptoms (child labour: IRR=1.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25; school lag: IRR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13), the higher rates of child labour and school lag, the higher the severity of depressive symptoms. There was no association between depressive symptoms and school attendance (IRR=0.98, \\n95% CI 0.93 to 1.04). These associations with school lag were found in Mexico (IRR=1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18) and Colombia (IRR=1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.41), but not South Africa (IRR=0.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04), while asso-ciations with child labour were only found in Mexico (IRR=1.16, 95% CI 1.08 1.25).\\nIn terms of access to health insurance and services, we \\nobserved a positive association; those deprived in access to health insurance and services had higher depressive symptom scores (IRR=1.12, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.28). These associations were found in Mexico (IRR=0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91) and Colombia (IRR=1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.55), but not South Africa (IRR=1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.39).\\nIn terms of the deprivations measured at the house-\\nhold level, our results showed that living in a household where other adult members were deprived in literacy was associated with lower depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset (IRR=0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99), suggesting a protective effect on depressive symptoms. There was no association for household educational achievement (IRR=1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), nor whether at least one adult had a long-\\n term unemploy\\n-\\nment episode (IRR=0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02). Those in which at least one of its adult members worked in the informal economy had significantly higher depressive symptom scores (IRR=1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15). In Mexico, there were no associations between deprivations measured at the household level and depression, while in Colombia long-\\n term household unemployment was \\nassociated with higher depressive symptoms (IRR=1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52). In South Africa the association was in the opposite direction: long-\\n term unemployment was \\nassociated with lower depressive symptoms (IRR=0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99), while informality was associated with higher \\ndepressive symptoms (IRR=1.29, 95% CI 1.19 \\nto 1.39).

Our findings illustrate the importance of country context in the relationship between multidimensional poverty and youth depres-sive symptoms. While a positive association was observed between depression and multidimensional poverty in \\nColombia and Mexico, an association was not observed for South Africa, likely due to the lack of an association for child labour and health insurance in this country. However, one dimension of poverty, formal employment by another household member, did show an association with depressive symptoms, as well as household income, suggesting that household income may be more protec-tive against depressive symptoms among youth in this country.\\nThe relationship between multidimensional poverty \\nand youth depressive symptoms is not the same in all countries, and our findings demonstrate that certain dimensions may be more salient for mental health in Table 4  Poisson r egressions of separate multidimensional poverty indicators on depressive symptoms of participants aged \\n11\\u201325 years from harmonised dataset and individual countries\\nHarmonised (N=16 173) South Africa (N=5161) Mexico (N=7405)Colombia \\n(N=3607)\\nIRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)IRR(95% CI)\\nYoung person deprived in (ref: no deprivation)\\n \\n \\nChild labour 1.17(1.10 to 1.25)1.02(0.86 to 1.21)1.16(1.08 to 1.25)1.25(0.99 to 1.57)\\n \\n \\nSchool lag 1.08(1.03 to 1.13)0.10(0.95 to 1.04)1.10(1.02 to 1.18)1.13(1.07 to 1.41)\\n \\n \\nSchool attendance 0.98(0.93 to 1.04)0.99(0.94 to 1.05)1.00(0.92 to 1.09)0.85(0.67 to 1.08)\\n \\n No health insurance/access to services1.12(1.07 to 1.28)1.18(0.99 to 1.39)0.74(0.61 to 0.91)1.37(1.20 to 1.55)\\nAny adult household member deprived in\\n \\n \\nEducation (literacy) 0.95(0.90 to 0.99)0.99(0.93 to 1.04)0.94(0.88 to 1.00)0.90(0.74 to 1.10)\\n \\n \\nEducation (achievement) 1.02(0.98 to 1.07)1.01(0.96 to 1.05)1.01(0.95 to 1.07)1.10(0.95 to 1.26)\\n \\n \\nLong-\\n \\nterm unemployment 0.97(0.93 to 1.02)0.95(0.91 to 0.99)0.96(0.81 to 1.12)1.25(1.03 to 1.52)\\n \\n No formal employment 1.08\\n(1.02 to 1.15)1.29(1.19 to 1.39)1.07(0.95 to 1.20)1.00(0.86 to 1.16)\\nHousing deprived fr\\nom\\n \\n Adequate material of floors/walls or access to sewage/water or over\\ncrowding1.06(1.02 to 1.10)1.04(0.99 to 1.07)1.08(1.02 to 1.15)0.98(0.86 to 1.11)\\nControls\\n \\n \\nAge 1.01(0.10 to 1.01)1.02(1.01 to 1.03)1.00(0.99 to 1.01)1.01(0.99 to 1.02)\\n \\n Sex (r\\nef.: male) 1.38(1.33 to 1.42)1.04(1.02 to 1.08)1.56(1.48 to 1.65)1.52(1.35 to 1.72)\\n \\n South Africa (r\\nef.: Mexico) 0.84\\n(0.75 to 0.92)\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\n \\n Colombia (r\\nef.: Mexico) 0.37\\n(0.35 to 0.40)\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nIRR, incidence rate ratio. on September 13, 2023 by guest.

In Mexico and Colombia, as well as \\nthe harmonised dataset, depressive symptoms seem to be associated with individual deprivations affecting the adolescent directly (such as child labour, school lag and access to health insurance), then with deprivations oper -\\nating at the household level (such as living in a household where other adult members are illiterate, have lower levels of education or have had a long-\\n term unemployment \\nepisode). \\nThese deprivations may prevent young people \\nfrom investing in their education, taking them further away from their future aspirations and expectations, which may lead to poorer mental health, independently of the education or employment of their parents. Consis-tent with this view, evidence from Colombia suggests that education is one of the most important factors contrib-uting to future aspirations in youth.\\n38 39 Future research \\nshould explore the causal nature of this association, to understand both how depressive symptoms influence educational attainment, as well as how educational attainment in turns influences future depressive symp-toms. Our findings suggest that there is less of an associ-ation between depressive symptoms and household level deprivations. However, our findings are consistent with an increasing body of literature suggesting that house-hold level deprivations have important limitations; for example, they are \\u2018gender-\\n blind\\u2019 as they do not consider \\nintra-\\n household differences by gender in resource allo\\n-\\ncation.40 Age and status within the household are also \\nimportant dimensions that may impact the distribution of resources within the household. Measuring poverty at the household level may thus lead to misclassification of poor individuals as non-\\n poor\\n, or overlook inequalities \\nbetween individuals within a household.40 This may be \\nparticularly important when measuring poverty among young people, given potential differences between boys and girls, as well as differences in the distribution of resources between young people and older adults in the household.However, an opposite pattern was observed in South \\nAfrica, where only one deprivation associated with adult household members, namely deprivation in formal employment, was associated with depressive symptoms, but not individual level deprivations. The relationship between multidimensional poverty and youth depressive symptoms is not the same in all countries, as the impor -\\ntance of specific dimensions for mental health varies across countries. In Mexico and Colombia, depressive symptoms are associated with more individual depriva-tions than in South Africa, where household depriva-tions show more associations with depressive symptoms. The disparity in findings across countries may reflect the high levels of unemployment and lower levels of earn-ings in South Africa\\n24 relative to the other countries. \\nIn 2019, unemployment levels in South Africa hit an all-\\n time high of 29.1%, and an even higher proportion \\nof 33% among young people, numbers that are likely to have risen further since the COVID-\\n 19 pandemic in \\n2020.41 The psychological consequences of unemploy-\\nment on self-\\n esteem, \\npsychological distress and depres-\\nsion in South Africa are well documented.42 43 It is also \\nimportant to note that each country has different poli-cies in place related to poverty which may confound the results. For example, the countries have govern-ment cash transfer programmes that provide household grants to low-\\n income households, that have been shown \\nto impact youth mental health, but these cash transfers differ in their volume, conditionality and targeting.\\n28 \\nFurther research should assess poverty-\\n reduction policies \\nthat might explain cross-\\n countr\\ny differences in the rela-\\ntionship between multidimensional poverty and mental health.\\nGiven high unemployment rates, young people in \\nSouth Africa may have reduced aspirations for the future, hence being deprived in education may have less of an impact on future aspirations and mental health. By contrast, in Colombia and Mexico, where youth unem-ployment rates are high by international standards but not to the levels of South Africa, poor education may be perceived as a limiting factor in achieving aspirations for the future, which in turn may increase depressive symptoms. Overall, it would seem as if patterns of asso-ciations were more aligned in Mexico and Colombia, potentially reflecting to some extent a shared Latin American cultural, social and economic heritage that shapes young people\\u2019s experiences of poverty and mental health. Interestingly, when we defined poverty based on income, individuals in the high-\\n income group did have \\nsignificantly lower depressive symptoms in South Africa, but not Colombia or Mexico. Clearly\\n, not all depriva-\\ntions are equally important for depressive symptoms in youth across different countries. These findings suggest that socioeconomic and country-\\n context must be taken \\ninto account in understanding the relationships between poverty and depressive symptoms in young people. Our findings should be followed by more detailed prospec\\n-\\ntive, longitudinal studies to determine the mechanisms \\nFigure 1  Plot of incidence rate ratios fr om Poisson \\nregressions of separate multidimensional poverty indicators on depressive symptoms of participants aged 11\\u201325 years from the harmonised dataset. on September 13, 2023 by guest.

A significant proportion of people earning the highest income were still classified as multidimensionally poor, while the overlap between the multidimensional and income poverty was low, demonstrating that both variables are measuring very different aspects of poverty and this may have a bearing on mental health. Some individuals not classified as income poor in our data were deprived in dimensions of poverty that are associated with mental health, for example, 87% of those deprived in schooling lag were not classified as income poor. Furthermore, there was no relationship between income and depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset. This demonstrates further that relationships between specific dimensions of poverty differ depending on country. Indeed, the relationship between income and depressive symptoms has previously shown to be inconsis-tent.\\n3 9 While household income may not always be asso-\\nciated with depressive symptoms, deprivations in other areas may impact their mental health. This showcases the importance of using a multidimensional approach and moving away from the more traditional measures of poverty.\\nFor instance, deprivation in school attendance was not \\nassociated with depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset or in any of the individual countries, whereas school lag deprivation was, suggesting two different mechanisms. A potential explanation is that depres-sive symptoms influence the ability to concentrate and perform well at school leading to school lag. In addi-tion, poor academic performance may lead to long-\\n term \\nnegative impacts on self-\\n esteem and increase the risk of \\ndepressive symptoms.44 School attendance deprivation, \\non the other hand, may be influenced by a wide variety of reasons which are not necessarily related to mental health, such as geographical location, or the availability of schools in the area of residence.\\nOverall, our findings highlight the fact that relation-\\nships between poverty and depressive symptoms in young people differ by dimensions of poverty and country. Thus, future studies should go beyond monetary dimensions of poverty and examine how specific deprivations relate to depressive symptoms in young people.\\nThese findings are particularly pertinent in the current \\ncontext of the COVID-\\n 19 pandemic. Research suggests \\nthat the COVID-\\n 19 crisis has increased global poverty \\nlevels45 and impacted youth mental health, particularly \\ndepression and anxiety.46 The impact of the pandemic \\nmay differ across countries depending on the severity of the pandemic, governmental support and countries healthcare systems. Further research should seek to understand how COVID-\\n 19 has impacted multidimen\\n-\\nsional poverty, how this has affected youth mental health and how these effects differ across different countries.Strengths and limitationsThis is the first cross-\\n countr\\ny examination of the relation-\\nship between depressive symptoms and multidimensional poverty among young people in three UMICs. However, several limitations should be considered. A more compre-hensive cross-\\n countr\\ny analysis with many more countries \\nis required to understand how this relationship varies in more diverse contexts across Africa, South-\\n East Asia, \\nthe Eastern Mediterranean region, W\\nestern Pacific, the \\nAmericas and the European region. While there is value in a cross-\\n sectional analysis, this approach did not enable \\nus to examine the complex dynamics of poverty and mental health in the same way that it would be possible in a longitudinal study\\n. In addition, some of the poverty \\nmeasures we employed may not capture the nuances of each country. For example, our measures in South Africa may not have captured the impact of very high rates of deprivation in access to health services and child labour. On the other hand, in sensitivity analyses that used an adapted version of the MPI that excluded these dimen-sions, the relationship with multidimensional poverty and depressive symptoms became significant, suggesting that these current measures in the MPI may not be valid for South Africa.\\nIn addition, it is possible that by including all indicators \\nin the same model, we are blocking potential mediating factors should, for example, individual dimensions be mediators of the association between household dimen-sions of poverty and depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, results were very similar when separate models were constructed for each group of indicators (results avail-able on request).\\nWhile it was not possible to look at the relationship \\nwith multidimensional poverty and other dimensions of mental health in the current data, we suggest that future research should explore whether different dimensions of mental health, to assess whether poverty relates to depression in a way that is different from how it would relate to anxiety or to schizophrenia.\\nThere are also limitations associated with the compara-\\nbility of our measure of multidimensional poverty across countries. There was a negative skew of the C-\\n weighted \\nsum \\nof deprivations in South Africa, where distributions \\nwere clustered more towards the higher multidimen-sional poverty, compared with Colombia and Mexico, where there was a more even distribution. Indeed, we find that the distribution of the MPI was significantly different in South Africa relative to Colombia (two-\\n \\nsample Kolmogorov-\\n Smirnov test=0.37 p<0.001) and \\nMexico (two-\\n sample Kolmogorov-\\n Smirnov test=0.12 \\np<0.001). \\nVisual exploration of kernel plots suggest that \\nthis might be due to a more compressed and right-  skew \\nin the distribution of the MPI in South Africa relative to Colombia and Mexico. It is also important to note that the \\nMPI was adapted for Colombia. This may explain why \\nwe did not observe significant associations between some poverty dimensions and depressive symptoms in South Africa. However, even if not fully valid for South Africa  on September 13, 2023 by guest.

Over the period of study, data from the World Bank suggests that the multidimen-sional poverty headcount ratio (% of total population) changed little for Mexico\\u2014from 46% in 2010 to 43.4% in 2016\\u2014and South Africa\\u2014from 8% in 2011 to 7% in 2016. By contrast, in Colombia, there was a decline in the multidimensional poverty headcount ratio, which went from 30.4% in 2010 to 17.8% in 2016. It is possible that the relationship between poverty and depressive symptoms for Colombia may have been different in the period covered by South Africa. As the group of individ-uals defined as poor becomes smaller and more selective, it is increasingly comprised individuals who are dispro-portionately disadvantaged.\\n47 As a result, there may have \\nbeen associations for Colombia but not South Africa as those in poverty were a more selective group than in 2010, where a larger fraction of the population was clas-sified as poor. However, these changes do not necessarily imply a change in the relationship between multidimen-sional poverty and mental health and are unlikely to fully explain the cross-\\n national \\nvariations we observed in this \\nrelationship.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn sum, the relationship between poverty and depressive symptoms among young people differs across dimensions of poverty and between countries. We found a signif-icant relationship between multidimensional poverty and depressive symptoms in Colombia and Mexico but not in South Africa, despite the fact that some dimen-sions of poverty did show an association with depressive symptoms in the latter. There were key differences across countries in how individual deprivations were related to youth depressive symptoms. Not all deprivations are equally important for depressive symptoms in youth across different countries\\nWhile household income was only associated with lower \\ndepressive symptoms at the highest income group, those with a high income were deprived in other areas which were associated with their mental health. This showcases the importance of using a multidimensional approach and moving away from the more traditional measures of poverty. There were associations with individual depri-vations, such as education, and not household depriva-tions, such as parental unemployment.\\nOur results have important implications for policy \\nas they highlight potential targets for interventions on deprivations directly linked to young people may be more effective in improving their mental well-\\n being than \\ninter\\nventions targeting dimensions of poverty which are \\nnot clearly associated with mental health. This includes interventions to tackle school lag, child labour and access to health services. Our results also suggest that the importance of different deprivations might differ across countries. Further longitudinal analysis and intervention using a nuanced approach that considers the specific poverty dimensions relevant for each country is critical to improve the mental health of young people in UMICs.\\nAuthor affiliations\\n1Health Service & Population Research Department, King's College London - Strand \\nCampus, London, UK\\n2Global Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's \\nCollege London, London, UK\\n3Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and \\nMental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa\\n4Alberto Lleras Camargo School of Government, University of Los Andes, Bogot\\u00e1, \\nColombia\\n5Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, \\nLondon, UK\\n6Global Health & Social Medicine, King's College London, London, UK\\nAcknowledgements\\n The support of the Economic and Social Research Council \\n(ESRC) is gra\\ntefully acknowledged.\\nContributors\\n AZ designed the stud\\ny, conducted the analysis and prepared the \\nmanuscript.

Essentially, the main rea-son lies on the multidimensional problems of quality of life. Then, a research question \\nyet unaddressed rises: Is it possible to find very poor people who feel happy? If so, what \\ncontrols this relationship? The first main contribution of this study is the application of \\nmodern measurement theory to measure happiness. The short Oxford Happiness Question-\\nnaire jointly with an ad hoc Multidimensional Poverty Index-MPI (8 items) were applied to a random sample of 537 household heads who live in the five poorest districts in Peru. \\nItem response theory analysis was conducted to measure happiness scores. Findings reveal \\nhappiness scores and the MPI are negatively associated in the very poor Peru. Friendship, religiosity, and some relevant non-material characteristics of a family are the most impor -\\ntant covariates of the relationship between these variables. In fact, the second contribution \\nof this study represents the inclusion of variables associated to the quantity and quality of \\nfriendship as relevant controllers of happiness and poverty.\\nKeywords Peru\\xa0· Happiness\\xa0· Extreme poverty\\xa0· Item response theory\\n1 Introduction\\nResearch on the relationship between happiness and poverty among the very poor peo-\\nple has almost remained untouchable since Graham and Pettinato (2002) identified the \\nparadox of unhappy growth in Peru and Russia: while poor people are happy, those with \\ndistinctive income gains are frustrated. Later, Lora et\\xa0al. (2010) found consistent results in Latin America. In contrast, the relationship between inequality and happiness has been \\nwidely studied in the United States (Alesina et\\xa0al. 2004; Oishi et\\xa0al. 2011), in Germany \\n(Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005), and in Latin America (Graham and Felton 2005). Across all this \\namount of research the constructs of happiness and poverty emerge, and some questions, \\n * Pedro Mateu \\n pf.mateub@up.edu.pe\\n1 Department of\\xa0Economics, Universidad del Pacífico, Jr. Sánchez Cerro 2050, Jesús\\xa0María, \\nLima\\xa011, Peru\\n1076 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nspecifically about happiness, are raised: how it is defined, how it is measured, how reliable \\neach measure is.\\nIndependently of previous questions, there are other interesting questions this paper \\naims to study: What is the distribution of happiness scores among the very poor people in Peru? Is there a meaningful relationship between happiness and poverty among the very \\npoor? What traits or characteristics of the very poor Peru, if any, control this relationship? \\nIs it possible to think that people who lived with deprivation, they could be happy in any \\nway? How relevant is the quality and quantity of friends for happy very poor people? To \\naddress all these research questions, household heads from the five poorest districts of Peru were surveyed in 2017 through an instrument that included the Oxford Happiness Inven-\\ntory, 29 items which show different manifestations of happiness.\\nThe existence of this kind of instrument, developed by psychologists Michael Argyle, \\nMaryanne Martin, and Jill Crossland (as cited in Hills and Argyle 2002, p. 1073) in 1989, allows the authors to improve the measurement of happiness. Given, the hypothesized \\nnature of this construct is continuous, item response theory was utilized to measure loca-\\ntions of individuals along the happiness. Conversely, poverty is a theoretical construct \\nwidely measured through different operationalizations. Multidimensional poverty index is the selected measure of poverty for this study; see Alkire and James (2011) for a complete \\ndiscussion of this measure.\\n2  On happiness and\\xa0measurement\\nThere has been an enormous discussion on what happiness is from the classical time. Even \\nif Aristotle set up a canonical definition happiness or eudaimonia, today the discussion \\ncontinues and the schools focus on particular aspects of that (Aristotle n.d./2009). Four \\ndefinitions may be stressed. From a perspective of several psychologists, happiness entails a state of satisfaction due to the situation of oneself in life which means to be able to pur -\\nsuit purpose or meaning in life with no restrictions (Alidina 2015; Csikszentmihalyi 2008; Graham 2017; Hone et\\xa0al. 2014; Steger 2012). First, happiness can be understood as a state \\nof continuum satisfaction which is fulfilled when controlling inner experiences (Csikszent-mihalyi 2008). Secondly, Alidina (2015) posited happiness as a level of mindfulness. It can \\nbe conceived as a state of alertness a person is to discard any negative feelings in the search \\nfor attaining happiness. Thirdly, Hone et\\xa0al. (2014) reported happiness as a high level of \\nsubjective well-being after a process of flourishing, not only as individuals but also as a community. Finally, happiness is represented as a direct effect of having sought purpose \\nof life and encompasses a person as a whole (Rappaport and Fossler 1993; Reker et\\xa0al. \\n1987; Robak and Griffin 2000; Steger 2012). Based on these four definitions, three terms \\nare used interchangeably: “happiness”, “subjective well-being”, and “life satisfaction” for \\nmany social scientists.\\nAlong the same lines, happiness is an outcome of having attained a set of targets. From \\nan individual standing, a person must prepare, cultivate and control their inner experience first to achieve happiness (Chen 2007; Koufaris 2002; Shernoff et\\xa0al. 2003). This learn-\\ning process implies the suppression of negative feelings (Academic Mindfulness Interests Group 2006; Langer 1989; Schonert-Reichl and Stewart 2010). Under a macro perspec-\\ntive, happiness is also the main goal of implementing public strategies that help citizens \\nachieve a high level of subjective well-being (Fredrickson and Losada 2005; Keynes 2002, \\n2016). Certainly, happiness does not represent a guaranteed outcome. In fact, these public \\n1077\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\nstrategies shall be considered as opportunities to seek fulfilling lives (Graham 2017). Thus, \\nthis paper suits the whole purpose of research when identifying needs or opportunities that \\nmay derive in public strategies with potential effects and ideal delivery.\\nFrom the umbrella of measurement, happiness metrics can be divided in hedonic met-\\nrics which capture the manifestations of happiness at a specific moment as daily lives occur; and evaluative metrics (eudaimonic metrics) which capture respondents’ manifesta-\\ntions of their lives as a whole (Delle Fave et\\xa0al. 2011; Graham and Nikolova 2013; Gra-\\nham 2017; National Research Council 2013). Most studies of happiness measure it with \\none single question “How satisfied are you with your life?” and “How happy are you with \\nyour life” for evaluative purposes (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Frey and Stutzer 1995; \\nHelliwell et\\xa0al. 2018), or “Did you experience happiness yesterday?” and “Did you smiled \\nyesterday?” for hedonic purpose (Graham and Pettinato 2002). In this paper, happiness is a latent variable.\\nAll psychological measurements are unreliable in some degree (Croker and Algina \\n2008). They asserted when a test is administered, the only way of assuring results can be \\nreplicated if the same individuals were tested again under similar circumstances is through \\nproviding reliability estimates of the test (Croker and Algina 2008). Then, before any meas-urement instrument is used for research, its reliability must be established. To show jointly, \\na degree of correlation and agreement between measurements, intraclass correlation coeffi-\\ncient (ICC) is a desirable measure of reliability (Koo and Li 2016). Under the classical test \\ntheory Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is one of the most used procedures for estimating reli-\\nability (internal consistency) and it is considered as the lower-bound estimate of reliability. \\nResearchers who use happiness measures do not report either Cronbach’s alpha or any ICC due to the dependability on a single question (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Frey and \\nStutzer 1995; Graham and Pettinato 2002; Helliwell et\\xa0al. 2018).\\n3  Study objectives and\\xa0questions investigated\\nGiven the importance of Peruvian very poor population living the five poorest districts of \\nPeru as a primary source of information for measuring happiness, the primary objective of \\nthe study was to improve the measurement of happiness and providing more evidence of \\nthe relationship between happiness and poverty. The focal questions investigated were:\\n1. What is the distribution of happiness scores among the very poor household heads?\\n2. Is there a meaningful relationship between happiness and poverty among the very poor \\nhousehold heads?\\na. What traits or characteristics of very poor household heads, if any, control this \\nrelationship?\\nb. What are the main characteristics of these very poor household heads who are happy \\nand why?\\n3. Can the results from the second research question consistent when using one single \\nquestion to measure happiness?\\nExpressed in the form of a null and alternative hypotheses related to find a relationship \\nbetween happiness and poverty among the very poor, they were:\\n1078 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nwhere /u1D70C represents a correlation coefficient, X represents the happiness scale and Y rep-\\nresents the multidimensional poverty index. The specificities associated with each scale \\nmeasurement are described in the “Method” part.\\n4  Method\\n4.1  Design\\nTo investigate whether there is a relationship between happiness and poverty controlled by \\nother factors, a nonexperimental design was utilized.\\n4.2  Sample\\nTo begin with, sampling units and unit of analysis are not the same in this study. The sam-pling unit of this study is the dwelling where a household lives in. The unit of analysis is \\neach household head (participant). The National Institute of Statistics -INEI in Spanish- \\ndeveloped a monetary poverty ranking of 1943 districts (INEI 2015).\\n1 Based on census \\ninformation of 2007, the dwellings database provided by INEI had a total of N=6889  \\nunique records for the five poorest districts of Peru.2 It represented the usable sampling \\nframe. A multistage random sampling design was conducted. In the last stage, the number \\nof dwellings were allocated in four strata according to gender and literacy of the house-\\nhold head. Each stratum is composed of one interaction of these two factors: literate male, literate female, illiterate male, and illiterate female. Sample size determination yielded a \\nrandom sample of n = 537 that was drawn from the sampling frame using a proportional \\nallocation accordingly.\\n4.3  Instrumentation\\nThe “Happiness, Poverty, and Values of Two Perus” survey contains 230 items divided in \\n12 sections (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, education, happiness, social network, \\npersonal values, and religiosity, among others). Despite the length of the questionnaire, it \\nwas designed to elicit only pertinent information to the study.H0∶/u1D70CXY=0\\nH1∶/u1D70CXY≠0\\n1 This study belongs to a large project named “The determinants of happiness in two Perus: 2017\" funded \\nby the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at Universidad del Pacifico (Lima, Peru). Its main aim \\nwas to compare the level of happiness between the very poor and the very rich population of Peru (two strata). This study only focused on the five poorest districts, the very poor stratum. All derived inferences only pertain to this group.\\n2 Technically, due to many dwellings in the rural area of Peru are abandoned, the number of dwellings is in \\nfact, the number of households. In this way, overestimation of sample size is avoided.\\n1079\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\n4.3.1  Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ)\\nThe OHQ consisted of 29 items with a different modified scale, four-point frequency \\nscale instead of a six-point Likert scale (see the complete instrument in the “ Appendix”) \\nHills and Argyle (2002) acknowledged the construct of happiness measured by OHQ is considered as unidimensional. During the nineties, it has been widely used in Australia, Canada, Spain, UK, and USA. However, Yamamoto et\\xa0al. (2008) stressed that happiness \\nis strongly influenced by culture, specifically values. Failing to address that implies the \\nomission of the role of each culture in any happiness conception. From that perspective, \\nthe OHQ also represents a composite instrument of measurement because it consists of \\nitems related to different definitions of happiness: hedonic, evaluative, optimistic, and com-munity involvement.\\nWhile conducting the pilot survey, it was noticed that there were two types of head of \\nhousehold based on their skills to answer abstract questions. Only 2 out of 10 interviewees were able to answer the 29-items instrument. To anticipate item non-response issues, the \\nshorter version of OHQ (eight items) was an option to answer questions regarding happi-\\nness. Thus, 81% of the final sample used the short instrument.\\nThe lower-bound estimate of reliability over these eight ordinal-level items was deter -\\nmined using ordinal \\n/u1D6FC (see Gugiu et\\xa0al. 2010), assuming a unidimensional measurement \\nmodel and accounting for the ordinal level scaling of the items. For the obtained sample \\n/u1D6FC=0.81.\\n4.3.2  Cantril ladder question (WHR)\\nSince 2015, the World Happiness Report shows how people from different countries evalu-ate the quality of their current lives on a scale of 0–10. Additional details of this question is \\npresented in Helliwell et\\xa0al. (2018). While conducting the pilot survey, it was noticed that \\na scale of 0–20 was reasonable for data collection due to the grading scale of the Peruvian educational system.\\n4.3.3  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\\nIt originally relies on 10 indicators embedded in three dimensions: health, education, and living standards (Alkire and James 2011). For this study, there were some ad hoc adjust-\\nments in the index calculation.\\nIn the first dimension, only the nutrition indicator was considered. It was estimated \\nthrough body mass index (BMI) as a proxy of caloric ingest due to timing reasons when administering the entire questionnaire. Regarding the second dimension, the dynamic \\nnature of the school attendance indicator was modified to a static indicator due to data \\navailability and renamed as childhood education (stock). No further adjustment occurred \\nwith the asset’s indicator in the third dimension.\\n3\\n3 The eight indicators used to measure the multidimensional poverty index were calculated as follows:\\n (1) BMI: Three thresholds provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) depending on age groups were used. (2) Years of education: Privation \\nexists if a household member aged 12\\xa0years old or older, has reached the level of incomplete primary edu-cation. If all household members are deprived, then household is deprived. (3) Childhood education: Any child aged 11\\xa0 years old or younger is deprived if his current educational attainment does not fulfill the expected level of education according to his schooling age. (4) Electricity: Privation exists if the household has no electricity. (5) Drinking Water: Privation exists if the household does not have access to drinking \\n1080 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\n4.4  Analysis\\nClosed-response data were imported to R 3.5.0 for processing and analysis (R Foundation \\nfor Statistical Computing 2018). For happiness measurement, polychoric correlations were \\ncalculated due to the polytomous nature of the eight items of short OHQ. Ordinal alpha \\nwas calculated through psych package. Then, IRT application through a graded response model (GRM) with logit link function produced an accurate estimate of each person’s loca-\\ntion on the latent construct continuum. Certainly, the discrimination and extremity param-\\neters were also estimated. The GRM postulates that the conditional probability of the ith \\nsubject to endorse the kth response for the jth item is expressed as:\\nxij is the ordinal manifest variable with Ki possible response categories, zi is the standing \\nof the ith subject in the latent continuum variable, /u1D6FCj denotes the discrimination parameter, \\nand /u1D6FDjk ’s are the extremity parameters. /u1D702ijk is the linear latent predictor related to the trait. \\nFinally, /u1D6F9() is the cumulative density function of the standard logistic distribution. Estima-\\ntion of model parameters required the application of marginal maximum likelihood estima-tion (MMLE) using Ltm package. A detailed overview of this technique is presented in \\nBaker and Seack-Ho (2004), Rizopoulos (2006), and Tarazona et\\xa0al. (2013).\\nWhen regression analysis was conducted, coefficients’ estimates and estimated standard \\nerrors are displayed where relevant. There is one single significance level, 5%. SAS 9.4 was performed for descriptive and inferential statistics.xij/uni007C.varzi∼Categorical/parenleft.s1Pij1,…,Pijk/parenright.s1\\nP�xij=k�zi�=⎧\\n⎪\\n⎨\\n⎪⎩𝛹�𝜂ijk�, if k =1\\n𝛹�𝜂ijk�−𝛹�𝜂ij(k−1)�, if 1<k<Ki\\n1−𝛹�𝜂ij(k−1)�, if k =Ki\\n/u1D702ijk=/u1D6FCj/parenleft.s1zi−/u1D6FDjk/parenright.s1,\\n−∞= 𝛽j0<𝛽j1<⋯<𝛽jKi−1<𝛽jKi=∞\\ni=1,…,m;j=1,…,J;k=1,…,Ki\\nFootnote 3 (continued)\\nwater or the source is located more than 30\\xa0min on feet. (6) Sanitation: Privation exists if the household’s \\nsanitation facility is not improved, in other words, there are not protected pit latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. (7) Floor: Privation exists if the household has a dirt, sand, or dung floor. (8) Cooking fuel: Privation exists if the household cooks with dung, wood, or charcoal very frequently. The last eight indicators report a missing value if the head of household did not respond to the related questions. After calculating all these indicators and their specific relative weights (they slightly changed in contrast to the original version), a person is identified as multidimensionally poor if he/she is deprived in at least one third of the weighted MPI indicators. In other words, his/her reported index is equal to or higher than 1/3.\\n1081\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\n5  Results\\n5.1  Sociodemographic characteristics of\\xa0the\\xa0very poor heads of\\xa0household\\nBefore addressing the research questions, two findings can be stressed when analyzing \\nthe main characteristics of multidimensional poverty of the heads of households who live \\nin the five poorest districts of Peru. See Table\\xa0 1 for detailed traits. First, one out of five \\nhousehold heads report a BMI lower than 18.5 (CDC’s threshold for individuals older than \\n19). Second, one out of five household heads report incomplete primary education as the \\nhighest level of education attained. Third, four out of five household heads have access to \\nelectric service as well as drinking water either with water connection inside or outside the \\nhouse. Despite these findings, almost 100% of interviewees totally lack access to proper \\nsanitation and almost every household head use wood as the main cooking fuel. Then, there are some health issues to consider when analyzing the poorest Peruvian population.\\n5.2  The distribution of\\xa0happiness scores\\nThe short OHQ consisted of 8 polytomous items on a four-point frequency scale: ‘never’ (1), ‘sometimes’ (2), ‘most of the time’ (3), and ‘always’ (4). Originally reversed-worded \\nitems were changed due to respondent inattention and confusion in two different pilot sur -\\nveys (Van Sonderen et\\xa0al. 2013). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 1, the response pattern in each question \\ndisplays a large concentration around the middle categories, “sometimes” and “most of the time”. Four findings can be underlined.

Regarding the estimated parameters, on \\none hand, Zickar et\\xa0al. (2002) point out that when 𝛼j>1 the item j  provides an accept-\\nable discrimination between individuals. Hafsteinsson et\\xa0 al. (2007) consider a highly \\ndiscriminant item when 𝛼j>2 . On the other hand, Thiessen (1986) recommends elim-\\ninating items which have a very low power of discrimination /parenleft.s1𝛼j<0.5/parenright.s1\\n . Considering \\nthese criteria, it was found all items have an acceptable level of discrimination between individuals along the continuum of happiness. Moreover, estimations extremity param-\\neters are acceptable (see Table\\xa02 ).\\nWhen analyzing the Item Response Category Characteristic Curves (ICC), there is \\na high probability of endorsing the first option, “never”, or conversely, there is a low probability of endorsing the fourth option, “always”, for relatively low latent trait lev -\\nels. These findings indicate that the items might be providing more information at low levels of happiness. Similar evidence can be derived from observing the Test Informa-\\ntion Curve (these graphical evidences are not shown but are available upon request). \\nThe set of eight items provides 62% of the total information for low latent trait levels. In fact, items “mentally alert” and “happy memories of the past” provide little infor -\\nmation in the whole latent trait continuum.

In the first \\ngroup of covariates, there are household head’s age (age), household head is female (fem), \\nFig. 2  The distribution of the happiness standardized scores for the short OHQ 8 items under the uncon-\\nstrained GRM]\\n1084 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nhousehold head is cohabiting (cohab), household head is married (married), household \\nsize (hhs), one child at home (ch1), two children at home (ch2), one adult older than 60 at \\nhome (old1), and two adults older than 60 at home (old2). The second group of covariates \\nincludes household head has elementary school education or higher (ese), household head is obese (obese), household head is self-employed or employee (see), working hours in pri-\\nmary job (whpj), and primary job satisfaction (pjs). The third group of covariates include \\nsocial network size with 1–10 friends (fri10) and with more than 10 friends (fri11), social \\nnetwork strength on a weekly basis (netwee), social net strength in a daily basis (netday), \\nreliable friends as an interaction of social network size with 10 friends or less and social network strength on a weekly basis (int1), perception of getting help (pgh); and God impor -\\ntance (god).

Regarding the first group of covari-\\nates, several and relevant non-causal effects were detected. Both age and sex of house-\\nhold heads, increase and decrease happiness ( p=0.005  and p=0.204  , respectively). In \\nfact, a female household heads reflect a lower subjective well-being in comparison to males. Marital status, either cohabitation or marriage, contribute positively to increase \\nhappiness and so does when a family’s first child ( \\np=0.031  ). The last two findings \\nare somehow opposite to Glass et\\xa0al. (2016)’s study for industrialized societies. They \\nclaimed lower levels of happiness among parents than nonparents. Along these lines, \\nwith a marginally significant effect, living with an elder person contributes to make a household head happier ( \\np=0.059  ) because this person not only can provide free help \\nto raise children (Dunifon 2012), but also can teach others on living experiences, as it \\nhappens in Asian societies (Rho 2014).\\nRegarding the second group of covariates, household heads are happier when they \\nearn complete elementary education or higher. As a proxy of health status, being obese makes household heads less happy. A similar direction in the effect is obtained when \\neither the household head works and for an additional working hour. All these four \\neffects are not statistically significant but are consistent with previous studies (Alesina \\net\\xa0al. 2004; Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Graham and Felton 2005; Graham and Pet-\\ntinato 2002; among others). In a sense of work-life balance, when household heads are \\nmore satisfied with their primary jobs, they are happier ( \\np<0.001  ). Although there is \\nno evidence for this claim in a rural context, there is for an urban environment (Nylenna \\net\\xa0al. 2005) and consistent with a meta-analytic finding (Bowling et\\xa0al. 2010).\\nFinally, when analyzing the third group of covariates, there are plenty of evidence \\nwhich support the presence of a social network in personal lives (Jiang and George 2015). Having at least one friend to talk to, to share experiences, good and bad moments \\nin a daily or weekly basis, indeed, generate happier household heads. In the very poor \\nPeru, the importance of God adds a spiritual environment which contributes to increase \\nhappiness of household heads ( \\np=0.0604  ). Analysis for multicollinearity by exami-\\nnation of eigenvalues and condition indexes revealed multicollinearity problem is not \\nsevere. Examination of variance inflation factors was omitted due to multiple coefficient \\nof determination is low. Finally, the null hypothesis for homoscedasticity failed to be rejected, \\n/u1D7122\\n(248)=196.52  , p=0.9931 .\\nThere have been several variables that have influenced happiness scores. Among \\nthese, it has been considered multidimensional poverty of the head of household, age, sex, marital status, having one child at home or living with an elder person or two, education, working hours, social net size and strength, religiosity to affect in the regres-\\nsion analysis. For starters, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) indicated that higher income \\nincreases positive affect. That analysis goes along the results presented, because more \\npoverty, used as another proxy of objective welfare, reduces happiness. Considering \\nAlesina et\\xa0al. (2004), age resulted in a negative effect on happiness, and that is congru-ent with the results of this study. According to Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005), being female \\nincreases happiness, but this is not the case for the very poor Peru, because of discrimi-\\nnation is still very present (Sulmont 2012). Furthermore, Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) found that married people report rising well-being, and the results of this study \\nreach the same conclusion. Alesina et\\xa0al. (2004) pointed out that children seem to bring preoccupations, stress and hard work and, thus, reduces happiness. Alesina’s study was \\nconducted in Europe and the USA. In Peru, there is a different view among creation of a \\nfamily. Thus, this study partially differs from previous literature because only one child makes household heads happier but two does not.\\n1088 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nFinally, as Waldinger (2017)4 stated, social groups are powerful health promoters, then \\nthe conclusion from the presented analysis when stating social net size and strength have \\na positive impact on happiness is congruent. Following the subject of religion (Kahneman \\nand Deaton 2010), religion has a substantial effect on increasing positive affect and reduc-\\ning stress, so this is congruent to the analysis and obtaining a positive effect of religion on \\nhappiness.\\n5.3.2  Profile of\\xa0those who are very poor and\\xa0happy\\nIn this negative association between poverty and happiness for the very poor household \\nheads, four scenarios can be generated: happy and very poor, happy and not very poor, \\nunhappy and not very poor, and unhappy and very poor; and one important question arose: \\nWhat is the profile of those who consider themselves as happy and very poor household heads in comparison to those who feel unhappy and very poor? As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3, three \\nfindings are quite relevant to point out. First, 26% of the happy and very poor household heads (n = 131) reported a lower proportion of no education at all in comparison to 44% \\nof the unhappy and very poor (n = 178).

First, 26% of the happy and very poor household heads (n = 131) reported a lower proportion of no education at all in comparison to 44% \\nof the unhappy and very poor (n = 178). Second, the happy and very poor ones reported \\na higher number of people they would ask for help in\\xa0situations of crisis (8.12) in com-parison to those who are unhappy very poor (3.41). Finally, regarding the social network \\nstrength in which a household head can talk to friends on a daily or weekly basis, the net is \\nstronger for the happy and very poor (34%) in comparison to those who are unhappy and very poor (22%). This difference is due to the cultural values of people living in the Peru-\\nvian Andes (Walshe and Argumedo 2016).\\n5.4  A partial consistent relationship between\\xa0life satisfaction and\\xa0poverty\\nThe main purpose of this section is to identify if the multidimensional poverty index \\n(MPI*) is consistently related to happiness when using two different operationalizations. \\nThus, two model settings which differs in the measurement nature of the dependent vari-\\nable are developed and controlled for a similar set of covariates in both cases. The first one considers the happiness standardized scores (HHS) which is a continuous score obtained \\nfrom the endorsed ordinal responses of household heads and transformed with item \\nresponse theory techniques. The second operationalization considers only one single ques-\\ntion with a 0–20 scale to measure happiness as life satisfaction and labeled as Contentment \\nof Whole of Life (CWL).\\nThere is a negative association between the life satisfaction scores and the multidimen-\\nsional poverty index for the very poor household heads. This indicates that the higher the poverty index is reported, the lower the level of contentment of whole life. Although the null hypothesis of no correlation was rejected ( \\np=0.0077  ), the strength of the relationship \\nis very weak ( r=− 0.1157 ).\\nTable\\xa0 4 reports the results obtained for both model settings.

Overall, these effect sizes are small and negligible -in terms of Cohen’s f2\\n—for specifications (1) and (5), respectively (Cohen 1988). Thus, in columns (1) and (5), effect sizes account for 4% and 1% of the happiness operationalizations variances, respec-\\ntively. For a Cohen’s \\nf2 to be considered a small effect size, it must be at least 2% but not \\ngreater than 15%.\\nIn the overall process of adding covariates, the control variables of happiness show a \\nmore consistent relationship with the first operationalization (HSS) in comparison to the second one (CWL). Despite MPI* lost statistical significance in specifications (3) and \\n(4), the direction of the relationship remained negative. In addition, only the variable ‘two \\nadults older than sixty at home’ changed the expected direction of the relationship, see \\nFig. 3  Profile of the happy very poor (HVP) and unhappy very poor (UVP) household heads based on a \\ngroup of traits. *The difference between these two groups is statistically significant at /u1D6FC=0.05\\n1090 P .\\xa0Mateu et al.\\n1 3\\nspecification (3) in Table\\xa0 4. This variation could be due to the presence of multicollin-\\nearity identified previously. Although was not severe, it certainly can generate incorrect \\nestimations. Regarding ‘contentment with the whole life’, certainly MPI* lost statistical \\nsignificance since specification (6) but what matters is the persistent change in the direc-tion of the relationship, see specifications (7) and (8) in Table\\xa0 4. Moreover, five variables \\nhave incongruent estimated coefficient signs when analyzing the specification (8): ‘female’, ‘only one adult over sixty at home’, ‘obese’, ‘self-employed’, ‘social net strength (daily)’, \\nand ‘reliable friends’. It brings some concerns how the direction of the relationship of these \\nvariables with CWL remains inconsistent and contrary to what was expected.\\nFinally, examination of the residuals with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normal-\\nity revealed that the null hypothesis fails to be rejected consistently for HSS models but is rejected for all specifications under CWL. Both full models for HSS and CWL -see speci-fications (4) and (8)- accounts for a certain level of the dependent variable variability, 20% \\nand 18%, respectively.\\n6  Conclusions\\nThis study sought to address three questions. The first question investigated the distribu-\\ntion of happiness scores among the Peruvian very poor household heads who live in the \\nfive poorest districts. One of the best contributions of this paper is the application of the \\nOHQ to measure the latent trait of happiness. The eight items of the short version revealed that, holding the assumption of an underlying latent continuum for happiness, the scores \\ndistribution is symmetric. When categorizing the variable, 66% of the very poor household \\nheads are unhappy. This finding is important because not only the measurement instrument captures different timing aspects of happiness (past, present, and future), but also due to the \\napplication of IRT, measurement error reduces.\\nThe second question this study investigated was if there was a meaningful relationship \\nbetween happiness and poverty among the Peruvian very poor household heads. When comparing happiness and poverty ( \\nr=− 0.1831  ), the result shows an opposite direction \\nto the paradox stated by Graham and Pettinato (2002) and Lora et\\xa0al. (2010). In both stud-ies, authors claimed while poor people are happy, those with distinctive income gains are \\nfrustrated. However, even in a context of poverty, there are household heads who are very poor and unhappy, as well. Several control variables influenced on this relationship. Traits \\nsuch as age, sex, and being married, also seen as a proxy of friends, revealed that happiness \\ndepends on them, equally or more. Similarly, to these objective traits, subjective character -\\nistics can influence the level of happiness of a person. If individuals experience good qual-ity of human relationships with family, friends and acquaintances, then they internalize that in moments of need, they have their own personal social protection net (Li and Kanazawa \\n2016). In this regard, perception of getting help plays an important role, the more people to \\nask for help, the more happiness scale reported. This help can be divine as well, the pres-ence and importance of God in quite a religious country as Peru is, contributes to increase \\nlevels of happiness (Marzal et\\xa0al. 2002; Valenzuela et\\xa0al. 2009). In fact, based on this sur -\\nvey study, 90% of very poor household heads in Peru indicated God was very important in their lives.\\nFrom the negative relationship between happiness and poverty, previously mentioned, \\ntwo groups were distinguished: household heads who are happy and very poor and house-\\nhold heads who are unhappy and very poor, to build up their profiles. Mainly, happy and \\n1091\\nHappiness and\\xa0poverty in\\xa0the\\xa0very poor Peru: measurement…\\n1 3\\nvery poor household heads trust in more people than the other group. Parallelly, not having \\nfriends and talking to them daily could derive in what Waldinger (2017) denominated, the \\ncrisis of loneliness.5\\nThe third question this study investigated was whether the results from the second \\nresearch question were consistent to the classic measurement of happiness (one single question regarding life satisfaction). Essentially this question tried to answer if there was \\nexternal validity of the results to a different measurement technique (operationalization) of the outcome variable. When comparing life satisfaction and poverty, the relationship was \\nnegative and very weak ( \\nr=− 0.1157  ). However, when controlling for other variables, this \\nrelationship turned out positive.\\nAcknowledgements We are extremely grateful for comments and advice from Enver Tarazona, Juan Fran-\\ncisco Castro, Cynthia Sanborn, and Edward B.

Since the unidi-\\nmensional indicator is extremely simpler and faster to calculate, if it is also fully\\ninformative, it represents a suitable solution for the measurement of poverty. When,\\non the other hand, the two approaches indicate two different sets of poor units, it is\\nimportant to evaluate the different information contained in the two sets.\\nA relevant implication of the multidimensional approach is the opportunity to\\ndivide total population not simply into just two subgroups, poor and non poor, as\\nit is done with poverty lines, but to detect a multiplicity of populations subgroups,\\neach related to different poverty levels, gradually moving from the completely poor\\nto the absolutely non poor condition.\\nA simple but effective method to detect different degrees of poverty, overcom-\\ning the dichotomy poor and non poor, is given by the fuzzy sets. Within fuzzy sets\\nbased methods it is possible to derive and to compose both multiple unidimensional\\nand also multidimensional indicators, thus allowing a more general and ﬂexible ap-\\nproach to poverty measurement.\\nIn this work we aim to address some issues related to the choice of the degrees of\\nmembership to the poor of the different population subgroups: this choice belongs to\\nthe researchers and, therefore, is frequently view as arbitrary and questionable. We\\npropose a simulation study in order to assess the effects on the set of poor units of\\ndifferent degrees of membership and to evaluate the robustness of the fuzzy poverty\\nindicators.\\nWe implement a rank correlation analysis able to provide an exhaustive compar-\\nison between the sets of poor units deﬁned by the different methods. The result of\\nrank correlation analysis allow to demonstrate that the two approaches deﬁne two\\ndifferent sets of poor households, and we also show how this difference increases as\\npoorer population subgroups are targeted. Overall our results suggest not only two\\ndifferent theoretical frameworks, but also mismatched empirical ﬁndings, with the\\nunidimensional indicator providing only partial information on poverty condition.\\nRelying on our conclusions, any socio-economic policy to reduce poverty devel-\\noped on the basis of income information is likely to no achieve its proposed goals,\\nbeing addressed to socioeconomic units which are, in effect, non-poor. Only in the\\nframework of the multidimensional approach it is possible to correctly individuate\\nthe set of the poor and to formulate actions able to reduce poverty.\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 3\\n1 Introduction\\nPoverty is a multidimensional condition, not exclusively related to an insufﬁcient\\nprovision of income or wealth, but the result of the contemporaneous occurrence of\\nmany factors [12], [15]. Multidimensional poverty is coherent with the concept of\\nsocial exclusion [1] [14], which is the target of modern welfare policies and which\\nalso represents a key element within the debate on alternative welfare measures to\\nGDP.\\nNotwithstanding the general consensus about the multidimensional view of\\npoverty, its quantitative measurement is frequently operated on the basis of a sin-\\ngle indicator, usually the income, thus implying that the empirical assessments of\\nunidimensional and multidimensional approach generally coincide.\\nIn this case, the multidimensional approach would be an elegant and theoretically\\nuseful development, without the need to implement it empirically. Since the unidi-\\nmensional indicator is extremely simpler and faster to calculate, if it is also fully\\ninformative, it represents a suitable solution for the measurement of poverty. When,\\non the other hand, the two approaches indicate two different sets of poor units, it is\\nimportant to evaluate the different information contained in the two sets [5].\\nOur main contribution is to compare the sets of poor units deﬁned by traditional\\nunidimensional and multidimensional approach. For this purpose we develop a rank\\ncorrelation analysis, able to investigate in depth the similarities between the different\\nindicators.\\nA relevant implication of the multidimensional approach is the opportunity to\\ndivide total population not simply into just two subgroups, poor and non poor, as\\nit is done with poverty lines, but to detect a multiplicity of populations subgroups,\\neach related to different poverty levels, gradually moving from the completely poor\\nto the absolutely non poor condition. Only 2 subgroups can represent a severe limit\\nwith just one inequality factor, but they are likely to be inadequate by using many\\ninequality factors.\\nA simple but effective method to detect different degrees of poverty, overcom-\\ning the dichotomy poor and non poor, is given by the fuzzy sets. Within fuzzy sets\\nbased methods it is possible to derive and to compose both multiple unidimensional\\nand also multidimensional indicators, thus allowing a more general and ﬂexible ap-\\nproach to poverty measurement.\\nIn this work we also aim to address some issues related to the choice of the de-\\ngrees of membership to the poor of the different population subgroups: this choice\\nbelongs to the researchers and, therefore, is frequently view as arbitrary and ques-\\ntionable. The weakness implied by subjective choices refers to their inﬂuence on\\nthe stability of the results, that is, on the robustness of the method. Despite the va-\\nriety of studies on multidimensional poverty, analyses on their robustness are still\\nat a preliminary stage. Literature offers some interesting papers, among the others\\nAlkire and Santos [2] analyze the effects on robustness related to a wide variety of\\nelements, while Duclos et al. [10] develop a meaningful proposal in the framework\\nof stochastic dominance. In the following we propose a simulation study in order to\\n4 Michele Costa\\nassess the effects on the set of poor units of different degrees of membership and to\\nevaluate the robustness of the fuzzy poverty indicators.\\nOur purpose is to contribute to the theory of multidimensional poverty measure-\\nment by providing evidence in favor of fuzzy sets methods which we suggest as an\\nefﬁcient and rigorous solution. A second aim of the simulation study is to evaluate\\nthe effects of different sets of weights, ﬁrst on the ﬁnal indicator, and, most impor-\\ntantly, on the deﬁnition of the set of poor units. We implement the rank correlation\\nanalysis by referring also to the simulated indicators, thus providing an exhaustive\\ncomparison between the sets of poor units deﬁned by the different methods. Besides\\nthe methodological aspects, our results are also interesting for applied poverty anal-\\nysis and for poverty reduction policies, where the focus is the correct deﬁnition of\\nthe set of poor units.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 critically introduces the basic of\\nfuzzy poverty indicators, Section 3 illustrates the Monte Carlo study developed to\\nassess the properties of fuzzy indicators, Section 4 compares poor sets deﬁned by\\ntraditional, fuzzy unidimensional and fuzzy multidimensional indicators, Section 5\\npresents a case study on Italian data and Section 6 concludes.\\n2 Fuzzy poverty indicators\\nMany Authors proposed, generalized or applied fuzzy sets based methods to the\\npoverty analysis, among the others [7], [4], [8], [13]. In the variety of the meaningful\\ncontributions, we make a speciﬁc reference to the totally fuzzy approach by Cerioli\\nand Zani [6] and to the relative fuzzy approach by [7].\\nLet be Athe set of the nunitsfa1;a2;:::;ang,Bthe subset of the poor units, and\\nm(X)an indicator function, which determines the degree of membership of the i-th\\nunit to the set Bwith respect to a certain attribute X.\\nThe indicator function transforms the achievement of a unit with respect to Xto\\nthe deprivation of that unit. A low or null achievement implies a maximum depriva-\\ntion, that is m(X) =1, while a high achievement leads to an absence of deprivation,\\nthat is m(X) =0. Traditionally m(X)can assume only two values, 1 for the poor\\nunits and 0 for the non poor units, and Xis the (equivalent) income; the well known\\nhead count ratio His the most famous example of this case, obtained when the pop-\\nulation is divided in two non overlapping subgroups, poor and non poor, on the basis\\nof a poverty line zwhich uniquely deﬁnes the subset of poor units B:\\nm(X) =\\x1a\\nm1with m1=1 ifX<z\\nm2with m2=0 ifX\\x15z(1)\\nand\\nB=[\\n(aijm(X)i=1):\\nWe obtain the head count ratio Has the ratio between the number of poor and\\nthe size of the population\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 5\\nH=n\\nå\\ni=1m(X)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni (2)\\nwhere m(X)iandniare the value of the indicator function and the sample weight of\\nthei-th unit, respectively.\\nThe presence of only two groups and the use of a poverty line zintroduce a high\\nrigidity in the analysis, since, given an eas small as desired, any unit with income\\nxi=z\\x00eis considered as a poor unit, while a unit with income xi=z+eis classi-\\nﬁed as a non poor unit. In order to overcome this limit, which also strongly affects\\npolicies and actions aimed to poverty reduction, it is necessary a more ﬂexible ap-\\nproach, such as the fuzzy method, able to allow more than two groups.\\n2.1 Fuzzy unidimensional poverty indicators\\nWithin the fuzzy sets, m(X)is no longer only equal to 0 or 1, but ranges between\\n0 and 1, thus allowing intermediate or partial membership to B: ifm(X) =1 and\\nm(X) =0 still indicate a poor and a non poor unit, respectively, values as m(X) =\\n0:8 and m(X) =0:2 refer to an almost poor and to an almost non poor unit, and\\nm(X) =0:5 to a neither poor or non poor unit.\\nThe ﬁrst problem encountered in the framework of fuzzy indicators concerns the\\nchoice of the number of groups to consider: while, in the classic case, two groups,\\npoor and non-poor, represent a forced choice, moving to k>2 groups A1;A2;:::;Ak\\nwith A=[AjandAj\\\\Ah=08i;j, the choice of kdepends on the preferences of\\nthe researchers.\\nIn order to obtain the groups, the possible outcomes of X, ranging between Xmin\\nandXmax, are divided in kintervals, one for each of the kgroups; the intervals are\\ndeﬁned by a set of (k\\x001)valuesfX1;X2;:::;Xk\\x001g, chosen by the researchers with\\nXmin<X1<X2< ::: < Xk\\x001<Xmax.\\nThe poverty attribute Xcan be a polytomous or a continuous variable (such as\\neducational level or income) or also a composite indicator speciﬁcally derived by\\nthe researchers combining different variables (such as ownership of the dwelling,\\nnumber of rooms and presence of toilet).\\nThe second issue related to fuzzy indicators refers to the necessity to associate\\nto each group a value of the indicator function, which therefore assumes kvalues\\nfm1;m2;:::;mkg.\\nIn this way the indicator function takes on a more complex form than in (1) and\\ncan be represented as\\nm(X) =8\\n>>>><\\n>>>>:m1with m1=1 ifX2[Xmin;X1]\\nm2ifX2[X1;X2]\\n:::\\nmk\\x001ifX2[Xk\\x002;Xk\\x001]\\nmkwith mk=0 ifX2[Xk\\x001;Xmax]:(3)\\n6 Michele Costa\\nA fuzzy unidimensional index evaluates the poverty condition with respect to a\\ncertain attribute Xand is obtained as in (4):\\nI(X) =n\\nå\\ni=1m(X)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni: (4)\\nwhere the main innovation is that m(X)can also assume intermediate values be-\\ntween 0 and 1. The head count ratio His a special case of I(X), obtained when\\nk=2 and the indicator function can be only 0 or 1.\\nThe fuzzy unidimensional index I(X), as the head count ratio, ranges between 0\\nand 1, and indicates the fraction of poor units on the total.\\nThe fuzzy approach does not possess a poverty line partitioning total population\\ninto poor and non-poor; in order to identify poor units, it is sufﬁcient to have the list\\nof the m(X)iin decreasing order and to obtain its cumulative distribution F(m(X)):\\nifF(m(X)i)<I(X)we have a poor household, while F(m(X)i)\\x15I(X)indicates a\\nnon-poor household.\\nThe subset of poor units Bis given by the union of the subgroups Ajassociated\\nto the highest values of m(X)from A1up to the subgroup Alto which belongs the\\nunit which fulﬁlls the condition F(m(X)i) =I(X):\\nB=l[\\nj=1Aj:\\nSince this unit is usually not the last of its group, also in the unidimensional fuzzy\\nframework we face a awkward situation: to the same subgroup Albelong poor units\\nup to the i-th and non poor units from the i-th.\\nA ﬁner classiﬁcation with respect to only two cases, 0 and 1, is a relevant im-\\nprovement, but the choice of the intermediate values depends on the individual re-\\nsearchers, thus introducing into the analysis a certain degree of subjectivity and,\\npotentially, of uncertainty and unstability.\\nOverall, in the analysis of fuzzy unidimensional indicators, we face two sources\\nof subjectivity, the choice of kand of the valuesfm2;:::;mk\\x001gand it is therefore\\nrelevant to assess the impact of both these elements on the ﬁnal indicator.\\n2.2 Fuzzy multidimensional poverty indicators\\nMoving from the unidimensional to the multidimensional framework requires to\\nidentify the different inequality factors and to deﬁne their number m, thus obtaining\\nthe structural economic, demographic and social factors fX1;X2;:::;Xmgrelated to\\nsome form of social exclusion and able to describe and interpret the poverty condi-\\ntion.\\nFurthermore, within a multidimensional framework, it is essential to derive a\\nweighting system which allows to rank the minequality factors.\\nFuzzy poverty measurement: multidimensional and unidimensional indicators 7\\nThe presence of minequality factors leads to introduce a second subscript j,\\nwhere m(Xj)idenotes the degree of membership to Bof the i-th unit with respect to\\nthej-th inequality factor.\\nFurthermore, minequality factors imply mindicator functions\\nm(Xj) = ( mj1;mj2;:::;mjkj)j=1;:::;m\\nwhere kjis the number of groups identiﬁed for the j-th inequality factor.\\nThe result of the matching between the nunits and the mindicator functions is a\\nmatrix M(X)with nrows and mcolumns, where the generic element represents the\\ndegree of membership to the subset of poor units for the i-th unit with respect to the\\nj-th factor.\\nBy columns of the matrix M(X), we derive the unidimensional poverty indices\\nI(X1);I(X2);:::;I(Xm)where\\nI(Xj) =n\\nå\\ni=1m(Xj)ini=n\\nå\\ni=1ni (5)\\nmeasures the poverty level, that is the fraction of poor units, with respect to the j-th\\ninequality factor.\\nBy rows of M(X), we obtain a multidimensional index for the i-th unit, I(ai),\\nwhich measures the multidimensional degree of membership to the subset of poor\\nunits for the i-th unit.\\nI(ai)is obtained as a weighted sum of the m(Xj)i\\nI(ai) =m\\nå\\nj=1m(Xj)iwj=m\\nå\\nj=1wj:\\nand ranges between 0, when the i-th unit is considered non-poor with respect to all\\nminequality factors, and 1, when the i-th unit is poor with respect to all mfactors.\\n2.2.1 The weighting structure\\nThe weights wjrepresent the distinctive feature of the multidimensional indicators\\nand measure the intensity of deprivation and social exclusion related to the j-th\\ninequality factor: the underlying guideline is that a factor not possessed by any unit\\nhas no effect on the social exclusion, while, on the contrary, if all the units but a few\\npossess the factor, it represents a relevant source of inequality and social exclusion.\\nA weighting system consistent with that is [6]\\nwCZ j=log(n=n\\nå\\ni=1m(Xj)ini) (6)\\nwhere wjis equal to 0 for m(Xj)i=1,i=1;:::;n, while wjincreases for decreasing\\nån\\ni=1m(Xj)i.\\n8 Michele Costa\\nThe case wj=0 deserves a special attention: it corresponds to the exclusion of\\nthe j-th inequality factor Xjand implies an indicator function for Xjwhich is always\\nequal to 1 for all units, that is: m(Xj)1=m(Xj)2=:::=m(Xj)n=1. When m(Xj)i=\\n18i, we assume that all units have the same value of Xjand that all perceive the\\nsame degree of poverty and social exclusion with respect to Xj. Furthermore, since\\nm(Xj)i=1, the same degree of poverty shared by all units with respect to Xjis\\nthe maximum: all are equally and most poor. If, for example, we do not consider the\\neducational level, we implicitly assume that all the units have the same qualiﬁcation,\\nand that this qualiﬁcation is also as low as possible: for the educational level it\\nmeans to consider all units as without any educational achievement, which clearly\\nrepresents a strongly unrealistic assumption.\\nThe effects of wj=0 are frequently overlooked, while they have a relevant im-\\npact, which we need to take into account.\\nA meaningful review of the issues related to the weighting structure is proposed\\nby [11], who stress both the relevance and the subtleness of this topic.\\nIn order to assess the role and the effects of the weighting structure, the pro-\\nposal outlined in (6) can be compared to other contributions, ﬁrst of all an equally\\nweighted index where we j=1=m8j.\\nA further set of weights can be derived from the budget allocation technique,\\nwhere the importance of the different factors is given by their budget share.\\nA ﬁnal proposal worth of attention is the structure wUNadopted by the Human\\nDevelopment Index [16], which assigns the same weight, 0.33, to the educational\\ndomain, the wealth domain, and the living conditions domain, and, within domains,\\nequal weight across indicators.\\nIn the following we develop the comparison of the unidimensional indicator with\\nthe multidimensional index on the basis of different weighting systems, namely we,\\nwUNandwUN.\\n2.2', metadata={'id': 'pdf2'})"
